# Inspiration

Victory Mansions loom grey under perpetual haze. The telescreen crackles in every corner. Footsteps echo down concrete corridors where all faces are blank, all thoughts monitored. Drum machines tick like surveillance cameras. Synths drone the Ministry's endless hum. No dynamic lift, no chorus, no escape—only the monotone rhythm of Party existence. The two-note surveillance "ping" appears for the first time, quiet but persistent.

# Style Prompt

Industrial post-punk at 85 BPM; cold analog synth drones with mechanical sirens, heavy grinding distorted bass, stark militaristic drum machines, static/white noise textures, sparse dissonant strings. Male baritone with numb monotone delivery; no traditional chorus structure, pure verses only. Surveillance "ping" motif (two-note synth blip). No uplifting progressions, warm reverb, dance beats, or polished vocals. Dystopian, oppressive, grey atmosphere.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Mechanical drum machine with synth drone; surveillance ping appears]

[Verse 1]
Concrete towers touch the haze,
Telescreens in every space.
Victory Mansions, grey on grey—
The Party watches every face.

[Verse 2]
Footsteps echo down the hall,
No one speaks, no one knows.
Monitored breath, monitored thought,
The Ministry's rhythm never slows.

[Verse 3]
Rations queue at seven sharp,
Two minutes hate at half past nine.
Every gesture must be right—
Stay inside the living line.

[Outro]
[Sustained synth drone; surveillance ping fades into static]
