## Entries

### 2025-10-16T12:09:06-05:00 — context-edit — remove coherenceism-* projects and tasks

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/projects/COHERENCE.md, context/projects/coherenceism-ai.md, context/projects/coherenceism-org.md, context/projects/coherenceism-project.md, context/tasks/coherenceism-ai/, context/tasks/coherenceism-org/, context/tasks/coherenceism-project/]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Removed three retired projects (ai, org, project) and cleared their task folders; refreshed projects index.
- Outcome: Projects and all related tasks removed; snapshot saved at snapshots/2025-10-16/1208
- Follow-ups: None

### 2025-10-16T16:54:11-05:00 — context-edit — refocus context/COHERENCE.md on context-only index; clarify scope in AGENTS

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/COHERENCE.md, AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Removed cross-repo directory map and load-order duplication from context/COHERENCE.md; added a scope note to AGENTS.md that COHERENCE.md files should be directory-scoped.

- Paths: [AGENTS.md]

- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Created `workflows/writing/` and `workflows/music/`; moved existing workflows and added archived stubs at original paths pointing to new locations; updated the workflows index.
- Outcome: Clearer structure for growth without breaking existing references.
- Follow-ups: Add `core/` workflows as they mature (checklist, validation runs, checkpoints).

- Outcome: No stale workflow paths remain outside logs/snapshots; links resolve to new locations.
- Follow-ups: None

### 2025-10-16T16:46:41-05:00 — context-edit — remove safety snapshot
