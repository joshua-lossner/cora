# Inspiration
Neon sky through rain‑wet glass; a clean, chorused arpeggio carries three notes—1–♭3–4—like a message finally received. The room breathes in plate reverb and 707 hats. Hook idea: “We’re already in it, already in tune.”

# Notes (optional)
Introduce the resonance motif clearly in the intro riff; keep verses spare and intimate; lift the chorus harmony without adding density.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative (post‑punk + jangle + dream‑pop) at 116 BPM. Chorused clean‑guitar arpeggio leads with a 1–♭3–4 motif, Juno‑style pads, TR‑707 hats layered with a tight live kit, and melodic chorus‑bass; baritone/androgynous close‑mic’d vocals with doubled choruses. Plate/room reverb; no modern trap hats, no EDM risers/supersaws, no glossy pop shine.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 10s]
[Clean arpeggio with 1–♭3–4 motif]

[Verse 1]
Glass roofs, sodium rain,
Signals climbing through the stain.
Static hum under the sky,
Someone else’s thought goes by.

[Chorus]
We’re already in it,
Already in tune.
I hear the carrier,
Cutting through the blue.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Motif trades between guitar and bass]

[Verse 2]
Pay phones, late trains,
Neon puddles, ghosted names.
Every window holds a line,
Threading into one design.

[Bridge]
[Bass and pads hold; guitars swell]
If you soften, you can hear it—
Every small life, near it.

[Guitar Solo: 8 bars]
[Motif stated on guitar; pads support]

[Chorus]
We’re already in it,
Already in tune.
I hear the carrier,
Running straight through.

[Chorus]
We’re already in it,
Already in tune.
I hear the carrier,
Running straight through.

[Outro]
[Arpeggio repeats motif; plate reverb tails]
[Extended fade ~12s]
