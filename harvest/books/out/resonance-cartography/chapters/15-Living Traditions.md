# Chapter
Tradition is a path, not a museum. Living traditions carry pattern while letting forms change. You name roots, show lineage, mentor methods (not outcomes), sunset with ceremony, and invite newcomers to add a leaf in week one. The system stays warm because people can see where they stand.

Roots — Keep a Short Lineage Visible
- One page: five lines that name roots (teachers, patterns, first rails)
- Show how practices (edges, maps, ledger, harvest) emerged and why
- Link receipts: the first past‑tense lines that carried
Lineage makes change safe; people can add without erasing.

Forms — Change Without Losing Pattern
- Pattern: reduce dead ends; Form: “Next + Why” in docs, hints in UI
- Pattern: safer change; Form: risk notes, small PRs, rollback
- Pattern: rhythm; Form: weekly ledger with human rows
When forms drift from pattern, compost forms; keep pattern.

Mentoring — Methods, Not Outcomes
- Mentors teach the rails (sentence, images, edge, ledger, harvest)
- Mentees apply them to their domain; receipts prove understanding
- No cargo‑culting forms; only pattern with proof
Mentoring grows stewards, not followers.

Sunset — Last Pages With Love
- Ritual: write a compost note with “fed” link; add three lines of lineage
- Ceremony: read past‑tense lines; thank the form; name the pattern it fed
- Practice: archive with a redirect; leave a trail so future hands can learn
Endings become fabric; beginnings feel invited.

Invite — Add a Leaf in Week One
- Ask newcomers to write one past‑tense line and one link
- Ask them to update a “Start Here” or add a ‘Because…’ line
- Let them sketch two images that made their week easier
Tradition that excludes dies; tradition that invites breathes.

Cases — Tradition Alive at Work
- Docs lineage: from lore walls → “Signals” with receipts; pattern preserved, form improved
- Eng lineage: from “hero merges” → risk notes + small PRs; pattern (safety) revealed; form humane
- Org lineage: from “alignment meetings” → Opening template + edges; pattern (coherence) held

Anti‑Patterns — Tradition as Costume
- Slogans without rails; quotes without receipts; ceremonies that center leaders
Retune: publish three past‑tense lines; show lineage; invite a new leaf.

Templates — Copy/Paste
Lineage page (short)
```
# Lineage — <Team/Practice>
Roots: <names/patterns>
First receipts: <three past‑tense lines + links>
Current rails: <sentence, edge, map, ledger, harvest>
Leaves invited: <how a newcomer adds one>
```

Mentor brief (one card)
```
Teach: sentence, two images, edge, ledger, harvest
Ask: show me a past‑tense line with a link by Friday
Listen: what felt clear / what still strains?
```

Metrics — Signs Your Tradition Lives
- Newcomers add a leaf in week one (count)
- Receipts added to lineage (count)
- Forms change without lost pattern (examples)
- Fewer “we used to…” speeches; more “we did…” lines

Q&A — Honest and Short
- “Isn’t tradition conservative?” Only when it worships forms. Living traditions conserve patterns that reduce strain.
- “What if a form is beloved?” Compost with dignity; show the leaf it fed.
- “How do we avoid dogma?” Receipts. If it doesn’t carry, it isn’t a tradition; it’s habit.

Leader’s Corner — Keep It Breathing
- Write lineage yourself; be brief
- Retire your own pet forms in public; add a leaf you didn’t invent
- Read three past‑tense lines at all‑hands; ask who added a leaf

Closing — The Thread That Carries
Tradition is attention across time. Keep the thread through breath, rails, and receipts. Let forms change. Keep the song.
