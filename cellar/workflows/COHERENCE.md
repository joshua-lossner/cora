# Cellar Workflows

## Purpose
Private workflows for personal rhythms, financial planning, and life documentation.

## Contents

### Daily Practice
- `daily-checkin.md` — morning/evening conversational routine
- `weekly-planning.md` — Sunday evening planning ritual (3-5 focuses for the week)
- `weekly-review.md` — reflect on week, check goals, reconcile budget, plan ahead

### Financial
- `financial-projection.md` — project cash flow for 1, 3, or 6 months based on budget
- `retirement-strategy-analysis.md` — comprehensive debt vs investment modeling with charts

### Personal
- `capture-memory.md` — preserve significant life events and milestones

## Notes
- These workflows are private to your cellar; not published
- Reference public CORA procedures when applicable
- Keep workflows lightweight; they're scaffolds, not scripts
