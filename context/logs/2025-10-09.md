### 2025-10-09T14:35:00-05:00 — context-edit — renamed UI hub and moved fruit into harvest/

- Actor: s_vektor
- Paths: [context/projects/coherenceism-org.md, context/projects/COHERENCE.md, harvest/COHERENCE.md, context/documentation/cora/knowledge-tree.md]
- Summary: Reframed coherenceism.ui as coherenceism.org (shared artifact hub) and renamed `content/` to `harvest/`, updating rails to treat artifacts as fruit stored centrally.
- Outcome: Domain naming matches role of the hub; harvest/ is now the canonical store for shared essays, songs, and other outputs.

### 2025-10-09T16:10:00-05:00 — content-add — scaffold album + 9 song_inputs (country‑soul)

- Summary: Added ‘Warm Signal’ album input (1970s country‑soul vibe) and nine per‑branch song_input scaffolds with consistent style pack and structures.
- Outcome: Ready to evolve album → out/, and per‑track create style prompts + custom lyrics, then move to dated out/ folders.
- Follow-ups: Evolve album frontmatter + sections; for each track, write style prompt + custom lyrics, then run song evolve/move.

- Outcome: Album and tracks ready for generation; in/ is clean.
- Follow-ups: Optional PR body; generate audio via Suno (custom lyrics) per track; consider a small resonance‑motif tag on 2–3 more tracks.

- Summary: Added PR summary and a compact resonance motif map marking where the three‑note tag appears or is hinted across tracks.
- Outcome: Ready for review/PR; arrangement guidance captured for consistent production.
