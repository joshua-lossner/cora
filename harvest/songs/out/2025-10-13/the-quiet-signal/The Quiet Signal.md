# Inspiration
Learning a tiny language of micro-gestures; restraint over motion. Rule: interpret twice, act once.

# Style Prompt
Cinematic downtempo at ~84 BPM; soft drums, analog pads, tape‑warm piano, close‑miked hush vocals with whispered harmonies. Sparse micro‑gesture motifs in percussion; restrained builds; a calm, confident chorus. [Intro: cafe room tone] [Break: fingertip taps, coaster turn] Negatives: no heavy reverb wash, no loud risers, no harsh distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Cafe murmur, cup ring]

[Verse 1]
Two fingers parallel on wood
Half a breath means understood
Eyes on space between the hands
Tiny moves redraw the plans

[Chorus]
Interpret twice, then act once
Let the quiet do its work
Answer only what you asked
Leave the rest inside the murk

[Verse 2]
Mirrored steps along the street
Lungs fall in and then retreat
Windows open, windows close
Hold the pulse the city knows

[Bridge]
[Coaster turns a quarter round]
Stop without a single sound

[Chorus]
Interpret twice, then act once
Let the quiet do its work
Answer only what you asked
Leave the rest inside the murk

[Outro]
[Train doors sigh; stillness held]
