# Inspiration

Position over force: we stop pushing and let the wave carry us. Verses hang back behind the beat; when the chorus lands, the guitars lift and spread. The hook should feel like catching the set at the perfect moment.

# Notes (optional)

- Slight tempo push in the chorus; keep drums roomy and alive.
- Variation: include [Pre‑Chorus] ahead of each chorus for lift.
