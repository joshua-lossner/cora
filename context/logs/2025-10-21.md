# Daily Log — 2025-10-21

## Entries

### 2025-10-21T22:05:00+0000 — context-edit — migration attempt and reversal

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [workflows/COHERENCE.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: manual migration attempt
- Summary: Attempted to migrate personal projects, tasks, and workflows from ~/Projects/joshua.lossner to CORA (retirement planning project, daily/financial/personal workflows). User clarified CORA is for content production only, not personal life management. Reverted all changes—moved everything back to joshua.lossner and restored original path references.
- Outcome: CORA remains focused on Coherenceism content production; joshua.lossner retains personal workflows and finance planning
- Follow-ups: None

### 2025-10-22T00:22:00+0000 — context-add — blog field-observation infrastructure

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/sources/rivers/, procedures/research/, procedures/writing/draft-field-observation-post.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-human-ai.md, harvest/blog-posts/]
- Procedure/Workflow: infrastructure build
- Summary: Built complete field-observation blog workflow. Created source lists for all 5 rivers (human-ai, agency, rest-rhythm, history-systems, awakening-alignment) with RSS feeds and extraction guidance. Created 3 core procedures: scan-rss-sources (fetch feeds), extract-field-signals (identify patterns), draft-field-observation-post (write in Ivy's voice). Created orchestration workflow for human-ai river. Established harvest structure (scans/, extractions/, drafts/). Blog posts now sourced from field temperature, not personal confusion—speaks to collective experience using coherenceism principles.
- Outcome: Repeatable capability for scanning cultural/tech field → extracting coherenceism-relevant patterns → drafting blog posts in Ivy's voice
- Follow-ups: Test workflow end-to-end with human-ai river; create workflows for remaining 4 rivers

### 2025-10-22T04:55:00+0000 — content-add — first field-observation blog post published

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/human-ai-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/human-ai-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/drafts/2025-10-21-the-boundary-that-wont-hold.md, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/src/content/journal/2025-10-21-the-boundary-that-wont-hold.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-human-ai.md
- Summary: Tested complete field-observation workflow end-to-end. Scanned Hacker News and Simon Willison feeds (curl approach after WebFetch failed). Extracted 4 seeds including AI browser agent security vulnerabilities, Wikipedia traffic decline, LLM brain rot, and Claude Code session logs. Drafted "The Boundary That Won't Hold" from Seed 1 (AI agent prompt injection vulnerabilities). Applied Mature Uncertainty and Technology as Amplifier principles. Published to blog. Removed all 24 previous blog posts to start fresh with field-observation approach.
- Outcome: Successfully validated workflow from scan → extraction → draft → publish. First coherenceism blog post generated from field temperature rather than personal processing. Ivy voice confirmed present in draft.
- Follow-ups: Create workflows for remaining 4 rivers (agency, rest-rhythm, history-systems, awakening-alignment)

### 2025-10-22T05:01:00+0000 — context-add — completed field-observation workflows for all 5 rivers

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [workflows/writing/field-observation-agency.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-rest-rhythm.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-history-systems.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-awakening-alignment.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: infrastructure completion
- Summary: Created workflows for the remaining 4 rivers to complete field-observation infrastructure. Agency river: tracks methods, tools, practical empowerment (inclusion test: "Can someone reuse this tomorrow?"). Rest-rhythm river: tracks embodiment, presence, cycles (inclusion test: "Does this change how I pace today?"). History-systems river: tracks governance, infrastructure, system patterns (inclusion test: "Does it name a reusable system pattern?"). Awakening-alignment river: tracks inner alignment, spiritual practice, meaning-making (inclusion test: "Is inner alignment the center of gravity?"). Each workflow follows same 5-step structure: scan sources → extract signals → review seeds → draft posts → publish. Updated all workflow files to remove "(coming soon)" markers—complete field-observation capability now available across all 5 rivers.
- Outcome: Full field-observation infrastructure complete. Can now scan any river based on what feels alive, building blog content naturally over time from collective field patterns.
- Follow-ups: None—infrastructure complete. Next step is operational: run scans and draft posts as desired.

### 2025-10-22T06:20:00+0000 — context-edit — CORA as canonical source, blog as presentation layer

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/, harvest/blog-posts/drafts/, harvest/blog-posts/out/, procedures/research/, procedures/writing/, workflows/writing/, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/cora/, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/src/content/journal]
- Procedure/Workflow: architecture refactor
- Summary: Restructured content system to make CORA the single source of truth. Initialized CORA as git submodule in blog repo. Reorganized harvest with monthly archive folders (scans/YYYY-MM/, extractions/YYYY-MM/, drafts/YYYY-MM/) and flat out/ directory for published posts. Migrated existing test files (human-ai scan, extraction, draft) to 2025-10/ folders. Moved published draft to out/ with status updated to published. Created symlink from blog's src/content/journal → cora/harvest/blog-posts/out/. Blog now reads content directly from CORA via symlink—single source of truth, no duplication. Updated all 3 procedures (scan-rss-sources, extract-field-signals, draft-field-observation-post) to use dated folder structure and documented publishing workflow (draft → edit status → move to out/). Updated all 5 river workflows with new paths and publishing instructions. Astro dev server confirmed working with symlinked content.
- Outcome: CORA is now canonical content repository. Blog is presentation layer reading from CORA. Drafts evolve into published posts (moved, not copied). Monthly archives preserve work-in-progress history. Clean separation between production (CORA) and presentation (blog).
- Follow-ups: Commit and push CORA changes; update blog repo .gitignore to exclude src/content/journal (since it's now a symlink)
