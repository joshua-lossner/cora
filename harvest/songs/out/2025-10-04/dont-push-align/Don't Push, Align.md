# Style Prompt
Grunge, mid‑tempo; verses laid‑back behind the beat, a short pre‑chorus lifts tension, then chorus opens wide with open chords and air‑after‑rain feel. Include held‑note motif as a surfacing accent. Male gritty vocals; chorus doubles; no pop gloss/EDM hats/synth leads.

# Lyrics
[Title: "Don't Push, Align"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~100 BPM]
[Chord Progression: verse on restrained drones; chorus opens to wide power chords]

[Intro]
[Dry drums; palm‑muted guitar sets the pocket.]

[Verse 1]
I tried to push the wave to come,
It broke my hands and numbed my tongue,
I learned to wait, to find the line,
To stand where all the forces rhyme.

[Pre-Chorus]
Count to four and don’t advance —
Feel the pull before the chance.

[Chorus]
Don’t push — align, let it carry you,
One held tone pulling truth into view,
Don’t push — align, ride the open wind,
Coherence starts where we let it in.

[Verse 2]
The room says when and how to play,
You feel it shift, you step away,
Then all at once the sound fits right,
The wave lifts up and takes your weight.

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold your fire, breathe it through —
Now the lift will carry you.

[Bridge]
[Break to bass + kick; small guitar harmonics.]
A single note, a breathing space,
The chorus hits — we find our place.

[Chorus]
Don’t push — align, let it carry you,
One held tone pulling truth into view,
Don’t push — align, ride the open wind,
Coherence starts where we let it in.

[Outro]
[Ring out; stick clicks count the last four beats.]
