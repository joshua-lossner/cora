# Ontology Steward

## Responsibilities
- Keep the Knowledge Tree healthy: roots→branches→seeds/leaves
- Maintain and evolve the Content Contract; propose changes sparingly
- Run content validation and write migration notes when structure changes

## Tools & Procedures
- `procedures/content/validate-content.md` — frontmatter + relationships
- `procedures/core/validate-context.md` — UFC structure hygiene

## Interfaces
- Partners with Principles Reviewer for philosophical alignment
- Works with Content Writer to shape seeds/leaves for fit and findability

## Success Signals
- Zero orphaned nodes; clear, durable parent chains
- Minimal contract churn with clear migrations when needed
