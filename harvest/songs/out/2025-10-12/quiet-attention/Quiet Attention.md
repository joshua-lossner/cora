# Inspiration

Presence as a hush that opens the room. Neon hum, slow street at midnight, a hand to the heart. The three‑note motif floats in the background vocals like a steady breath.

# Style Prompt

1950s doo‑wop ballad around 92 BPM with brushed drums, gentle upright bass, clean guitar with light slapback, soft piano, and airy background “oohs.” Warm lead vocal in English; include a subtle [Bridge] lift before the final chorus. Keep a mono‑ish room image; no modern trap/EDM, autotune, or contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Soft guitar and “oohs”]

[Verse 1]
Coffee cup steam and a window of rain,
Streetlight silver on a quiet lane,
Hands in the still and a name in my chest,
Silence like music when it’s held with the best.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you,
Quiet attention, soft and new,
The room turns gold when I see it through.

[Verse 2]
Breath like a tide and a clock taking rest,
Neon hum low like a hymn in the west,
Nothing to prove and nothing to chase,
Just you and the moment with a little more space.

[Bridge]
[Under‑voice “oohs” echo the three‑note motif]
If I stop the rush and let it be,
All the tiny lights sing back to me.

[Chorus]
Quiet attention, hold me true,
I hear the world when I lean to you.

[Outro]
[Soft sax phrase; gentle fade]
