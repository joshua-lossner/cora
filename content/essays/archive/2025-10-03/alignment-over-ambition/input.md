# Notes
- Many orgs choose big goals before fit; drift and rework follow.
- Alignment: pick moves that reduce distortion; force falls away.
- Examples: roadmap pruning; saying no to misfit features; hiring bar held.
- Practical moves: write one “why now”; cut one scope; weekly alignment check.
- Counterpoint: ambition spikes are fine when aligned; checkpoint quickly.
