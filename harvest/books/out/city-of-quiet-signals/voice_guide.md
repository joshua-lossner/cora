# Voice Guide — City of Quiet Signals

## Voice Rails
- POV: Third‑person limited (Mara primary; occasional chapter in Jae). Scene‑level POV only.
- Tense: Past
- Distance: Close (stay near breath and touch; rarely zoom out)

## Diction & Cadence
- Diction: Plain with precise sensory anchors; technical terms only on contact (e.g., when touching devices)
- Cadence: 2–3 short sentences to one medium; one longer reflective line per chapter
- Imagery: Small mechanical details (LED blink, switch click), transit smells, paper textures

## Devices (Allowed)
- Free indirect style for interior pivots
- Scene/Sequel rhythm; keep sequels brief
- Chapter ends: small open loop; no cliff theatrics

## Negatives (Exclusions)
- No head‑hopping; no lore dumps; no named brand worship
- Avoid tidy speeches; truths arrive in gestures and collisions

## Sample Lines
- The map didn’t show the hum, but her fingers did. Paper carried a low current when the car doors sealed and the city exhaled.
- Jae spoke in the negative: a touch on the table, a breath held one beat too long.
- The archive listened back, shelves settling like a creature adjusting in sleep.
