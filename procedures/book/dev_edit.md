# Procedure — Developmental Edit (Chapter)

Purpose
- Strengthen macro structure and intent so the chapter advances character/plot cleanly.

Inputs
- chapter draft body
- beats, outline, character bible

Steps
1) Purpose check
   - Does the chapter change state/knowledge/relationship? Clarify if not.
2) Scene audit
   - Mark scenes without a turn; collapse or refocus. Ensure scene/sequel balance.
3) Pacing
   - Adjust paragraph density and scene length; add/remove micro‑turns.
4) Arc alignment
   - Ensure character choices reflect current arc position; fix contradictions.
5) Notes for line edit
   - List hotspots to tighten later (voice slips, repetition).
6) Wordcount check (optional)
   - Compare to target_per_chapter ± tolerance; flag if outside. Recommend expansions (micro‑scenes, lived examples) or trims (redundancy) as needed.

Expected
- A revised chapter body and a short bullet list of edit notes.
