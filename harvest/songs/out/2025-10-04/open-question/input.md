# Inspiration

Hold precision and wonder together. Suspended chords and a darker bridge leave questions open; the chorus doesn’t resolve fully, it lingers. The motif returns as a distant light rather than a shout.

# Notes (optional)

- Widen reverb on the bridge guitars; let tails bloom then tighten again for the chorus.
