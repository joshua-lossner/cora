# Inspiration
The room decides without force. Verses sit close; the chorus breathes wider but stays quiet. One‑breath reset as a count‑in.

# Notes (optional)
Favor space; let bass take small melodic turns between vocal lines.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 90 BPM; clean chorused guitar, subtle pad, tight roomy kit, melodic forward bass; baritone/androgynous close‑mic’d vocal. Keep dynamics restrained; chorus widens without volume jump. Plate/room verbs; no modern trap hats/EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 8s]
[Soft count‑in; room tone]

[Verse 1]
The door hushes when it swings,
Air decides the way we speak.
Every voice a smaller ring,
Falling into something deep.

[Chorus]
No signs, no rules,
Still the room is choosing.
Quiet attention
Turns the world to music.

[Verse 2]
Breath returns like borrowed time,
Pages whisper down the spine.
Every glance a tuning fork,
Not a word, and yet—report.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Bass and drums carry; guitar outlines motif]

[Bridge]
[Bass and drums alone for two bars]
One slow breath—arrive.

[Chorus]
No signs, no rules,
Still the room is choosing.
Quiet attention
Turns the world to music.

[Chorus]
No signs, no rules,
Still the room is choosing.
Quiet attention
Turns the world to music.

[Outro]
[Bass figure answers guitar]
