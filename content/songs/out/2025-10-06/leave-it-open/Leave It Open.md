# Inspiration
Mystery with precision: ask the question, let it ring. Post‑chorus repeats an open‑ended line; synths shimmer with gentle halation.

# Notes (optional)
Use airy “ooh” stacks in the post‑chorus; delay tails hint at the motif.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band reflective pop at 98 BPM. Suspended synth chords, soft pop kit, clean guitar, side‑chained sub‑bass, airy stacked harmonies. Chorus invites uncertainty; post‑chorus repeats an open line. No heavy EDM drops or harsh distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Suspended chords; gentle kit]

[Verse 1]
We always rush to put a name on everything,
But some truths bloom only when we let them sing.
Leave a little space between the breath and word—
That’s where what we meant is heard.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Hold it lightly, let it shine,
We don’t have to draw the line.

[Chorus]
Leave it open,
Don’t decide too soon.
There’s a window in the question—
Let the sky come through.

[Verse 2]
Footsteps in a hallway, echoes find their rhyme,
We learn the song by living it in time.
You don’t need to close the book to make it real—
Let it tell us what we feel.

[Bridge]
[Vocal pad “ooh” stack]
Choose the wonder, hold the frame,
We can start again the same.

[Chorus]
Leave it open,
Don’t decide too soon.
There’s a window in the question—
Let the sky come through.

[Post‑Chorus]
Leave it open (ooh), leave it open.

[Outro]
[Chords bloom; delay tails]
