# Beats
- Mara maps train noise patterns during her commute.
- A stranger (Jae) points to a blank corridor on her paper map.
- The archive’s stacks hum differently when the power cycles.
- She notices a deliberate pause in announcements: a gap.
- Jae leaves a coaster rotated 45°; she chooses to notice.

# Notes
- Keep interior close; end on her copying the blank corridor onto a clean card.

# Chapter
The car’s lights buzzed at a pitch she could almost file. High, then a jitter just before the doors came together. She counted by breath because seconds in the city slipped, stretched, lied. Breath steadied. On the map in her lap she penciled slashes where the hum climbed, dots where it fell. The paper had been folded and unfolded enough times to remember her hands.

At West Halley the announcement stuttered — two words clipped, one swallowed — and the whole train seemed to pause half a heartbeat between chime and close. The pause sat in her chest like a finger held up: wait.

Across from her, the stranger who had boarded without a phone and with shoes that made no sound watched the tunnel wall instead of his reflection. He was young in the way quiet people are, not in face but in edges. When the train slid into the next stretch he leaned forward, not toward her but to the map. A fingertip hovered above the printed lines, then tapped a space where there was no corridor at all.

“There,” he said, and then nothing else. The fingertip withdrew. He didn’t meet her eyes. The car wheezed; doors sighed open.

She looked at the spot. Blank as paper is blank, except paper is never blank. The tunnel lights flickered and for a moment the white carried a faint grid, as if the city had printed under the map and she was seeing through. She shaded the empty with the side of her pencil until the area took a ghost hue, then boxed it with a light hand. The stranger had already stood. When the doors closed the shoes didn’t complain.

The archive breathed differently at night. HVAC off meant the building’s real sounds spoke up: wood expanding, a cable settling, the distant street like a seashell at one ear. She liked those hours because the stacks became rooms, not rows. Her cart’s wheels discovered seams she hadn’t felt before. In the far corner the fluorescent tubes flickered once when the emergency circuits tested the line. She’d thought of it as annoyance; now she waited for it the way she’d waited for the pause on the train.

At the front desk the radio they never used sat with a broken antenna. She turned its knob, then turned it back. The turn left an absence, a small pressure at her fingers where resistance had been. Jae — that was what the stranger would later write when she asked his name — had touched the table with a fingernail near her map just once in the cafe that afternoon, and she’d watched the ring in her cup answer. She didn’t know the language but she knew there was one.

An announcement on the last train had cut out on the street name that mattered. The gap was cleaner than the words. She drew it as a long dash on the margin of her card and felt absurd for doing it on paper, then certain the paper would keep it honest. Screens did what they were told. Paper complained when pressed too hard, and she could hear her pressure in it.

At closing she sat in the little staff kitchen where mugs recorded other mouths and old coffee managed to smell metallic. The coaster under her glass had a water stain in a neat ring like a planet’s orbit. When she stood to rinse, the coaster stuck a moment then fell back with a damp whisper. Someone had rotated it forty‑five degrees. Not a fluke. Wood grain lined up with the table’s scar like a pointer.

She laughed once — at herself, at the city, at the fact that a room with no one else in it could feel crowded with signs. Then she pulled a clean card from the box. The card had a faint tooth. She copied the blank corridor in the careful hand she used for labels. Not a corridor, she wrote in the corner, but a place where the map pretended not to see.
