# Inspiration

Two plus two equals five. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. The Ministry's contradictions loop endlessly until they become true. Synths clash in dissonant harmony. Drum machines stutter and lose the beat. Propaganda broadcasts layer over each other—competing truths, all equally false. Winston's voice is hollow, accepting the impossible. Memory dissolves. The surveillance ping continues, now just another piece of the accepted reality.

# Notes (optional)

- Add spoken-word propaganda samples in Intro and Outro (per album structure notes)
- Use dissonance and rhythmic instability to create disorientation
- Vocals should sound confused, defeated, mechanically accepting contradictions
- Could layer multiple vocal tracks saying contradictory things simultaneously
- Surveillance ping continues but now feels "normal" rather than threatening
- No harmonic resolution—end on dissonance to emphasize cognitive fracture
