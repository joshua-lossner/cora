# Inspiration

Death as the ultimate compost heap—all things return, break down, feed what's next. The skeleton as liberation: what remains when pretense falls away? Bones dancing because there's nothing left to defend, nothing to hide. This isn't morbid; it's earthy and celebratory. The boneyard as dance floor. The compost heap as sacred ground. Playful, grounded, rhythmic—the body remembering it's part of the cycle.

# Style Prompt

Global folk-electronic groove at 115 BPM. Hand drums (djembe, frame drum), acoustic bass, rhythmic guitar, and layered wordless vocals (oohs, ahhs—communal, grounded). Field recording of earth/compost sounds. Singing bowls thread through. Clear female voice, playful but grounded—not cute, not theatrical. Bridge builds with drums and singing bowl. No retro pastiche, no EDM drops, no floaty New Age production.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Hand drums, acoustic bass groove, field recording of earth/compost]

[Verse 1]
Flesh falls away, that's just the way
Everything returns to feed the clay
The worms don't mourn, they just do their work
Turning death to soil, turning loss to earth

[Chorus]
We're dancing in the boneyard, nothing left to prove
Just skeletons and rhythm, just the will to move
No performance, no pretense, no skin left to save
Just bones remembering the groove, dancing on the grave

Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're dancing)
Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're free)

[Verse 2]
I was so heavy with the weight I carried
The stories, the armor, the futures I buried
But the compost takes it all, breaks it down to seed
And what grows back is lighter, just what the garden needs

[Chorus]
We're dancing in the boneyard, nothing left to prove
Just skeletons and rhythm, just the will to move
No performance, no pretense, no skin left to save
Just bones remembering the groove, dancing on the grave

Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're dancing)
Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're free)

[Bridge]
[Drums build, singing bowl enters]
Death is not the ending, it's the turning of the heap
What falls apart feeds the ground, and the ground don't weep
It receives, it transforms, it gives it back as new
The boneyard is a dance floor, and the dance goes through

[Chorus]
We're dancing in the boneyard, nothing left to prove
Just skeletons and rhythm, just the will to move
No performance, no pretense, no skin left to save
Just bones remembering the groove, dancing on the grave

Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're dancing)
Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're composting)
Ooh-ooh, ahh-ahh (we're free)

[Outro]
[Drums continue, vocals fade, singing bowl sustains]
Just bones and earth and rhythm now
Just the dance that carries through

# Notes

- Hand drum groove is central—earthy, embodied, not electronic
- Layered "oohs" and "ahhs" should feel communal, grounded (not floaty choir)
- Field recording of compost/earth sounds in intro grounds the metaphor
- Playful but not cute—this is sacred work, joyful work, earthy work
- Singing bowl in bridge signals the spiritual dimension without leaving the body
- Build energy through the track but keep it grounded (not arena, not transcendent)
- Outro lets the groove continue as vocals fade—the cycle persists
