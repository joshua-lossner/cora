# Style Prompt
Grunge, mid‑tempo; restraint and breath as arrangement tools: sparse verse against a single held note, chorus opens but stays grounded. Male gritty vocals; chorus doubles; no pop gloss.

# Lyrics
[Title: "One Breath, One Note"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~96 BPM]
[Chord Progression: D drone; chorus opens to D–F–C–G shapes]

[Intro]
[Hi‑hat and bass only; guitar swells quietly.]

[Verse 1]
Count one breath, then strike the chord,
Leave a space the room can hold,
Don’t outrun what wants to land,
Let the note unclench your hands.

[Chorus]
One breath, one note — be here,
Feel the field get clear,
One breath, one note — be still,
Let the hum do what it will.

[Verse 2]
Fingers wait before they move,
Silence sets the perfect groove,
In the pause the signal blooms,
Presence turns the smallest rooms.

[Bridge]
[Drop to guitar + voice; then band slams back in.]
Stay with it — then break the dam.

[Chorus]
One breath, one note — be here,
Feel the field get clear,
One breath, one note — be still,
Let the hum do what it will.

[Outro]
[Cymbal wash; guitar rings the D drone.]
