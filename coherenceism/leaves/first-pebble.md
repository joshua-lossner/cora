# Practice — Your First Pebble

Before you close this, choose one small act:

- A conversation you’ll approach with more listening than talking.
- A habit you’ll release that feeds noise into the field.
- A post, message, or piece of work crafted to carry clarity outward.

Make it small enough to do today. Make it real enough to matter.
