# Inspiration
Ethics as field‑strength: cut the blur, choose the line that holds. Verses trace the city at night; chorus resolves with a subtle major tint. Refrain: “Make the field stronger.”

# Notes (optional)
Let guitars sharpen in the bridge; keep snare gated but not harsh.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 118 BPM; palm‑muted clean guitar, pad for chorus lift, tight kit with tasteful gate, melodic bass; baritone close‑mic’d vocal. Chorus has subtle major tint. Plate/room verbs; exclude modern trap hats and EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 6s]
[Palm‑mute pulse]

[Verse 1]
Late shift on a yellow line,
Coffee breath and winter signs.
Every shortcut makes it worse—
Smear the glass, the road reverses.

[Pre‑Chorus]
One clear path, one steady view—
I’ll hold the line with you.

[Chorus]
Make the field stronger,
Cut the blur in two.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

[Verse 2]
Neon tries to sell me more,
I close the tab, lock the door.
One true thing is enough tonight,
A single path, a steady light.

[Pre‑Chorus]
One clear path, one steady view—
I’ll hold the line with you.

[Bridge]
[Guitars sharpen; kit stays tight]
I won’t trade signal for a louder sound.

[Guitar Solo: 8 bars]
[Over chorus changes]

[Chorus]
Make the field stronger,
Cut the blur in two.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

[Chorus]
Make the field stronger,
Cut the blur in two.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

[Outro]
[Major‑tint pad; pulse fades]
