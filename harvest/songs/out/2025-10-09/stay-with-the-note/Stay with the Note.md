# Inspiration
Kitchen table before dawn. Steam from a mug, the house still, a single tone holding the room together. Verses move through small distractions returning to breath; Chorus repeats the practice line: stay with the note.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “When it wants to wander, stay with the note.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul ballad at 78 BPM; fingerpicked clean guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, warm bass, brushed kit; intimate baritone and hushed BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus] and a double [Chorus]; very soft [Outro]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Steam and hush; soft guitar]

[Verse 1]
Kettle sings a quiet line,
Window holds the edge of time.
All the little voices float—
I breathe and stay with one small note.

[Pre‑Chorus]
When it pulls me off the road,
I listen till I’m back in mode.

[Chorus]
Stay with the note,
Let the wandering go.

[Verse 2]
Headlights fade across the wall,
Phone lights up and then it falls.
Hands around a warming cup,
I hear the stillness wake me up.

[Bridge]
[Organ swells; BGV hum]
Nothing loud and nothing grand,
Just the tone my life can stand.

[Chorus]
Stay with the note,
Let the wandering go.

[Chorus]
Stay with the note,
Let the wandering go.

[Outro]
[BGV ahs; fade]
