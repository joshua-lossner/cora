# Daily Log — 2025-10-21

## Entries

### 2025-10-21T22:05:00+0000 — context-edit — migration attempt and reversal

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [workflows/COHERENCE.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: manual migration attempt
- Summary: Attempted to migrate personal projects, tasks, and workflows from ~/Projects/joshua.lossner to CORA (retirement planning project, daily/financial/personal workflows). User clarified CORA is for content production only, not personal life management. Reverted all changes—moved everything back to joshua.lossner and restored original path references.
- Outcome: CORA remains focused on Coherenceism content production; joshua.lossner retains personal workflows and finance planning
- Follow-ups: None

### 2025-10-22T00:22:00+0000 — context-add — blog field-observation infrastructure

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/sources/rivers/, procedures/research/, procedures/writing/draft-field-observation-post.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-human-ai.md, harvest/blog-posts/]
- Procedure/Workflow: infrastructure build
- Summary: Built complete field-observation blog workflow. Created source lists for all 5 rivers (human-ai, agency, rest-rhythm, history-systems, awakening-alignment) with RSS feeds and extraction guidance. Created 3 core procedures: scan-rss-sources (fetch feeds), extract-field-signals (identify patterns), draft-field-observation-post (write in Ivy's voice). Created orchestration workflow for human-ai river. Established harvest structure (scans/, extractions/, drafts/). Blog posts now sourced from field temperature, not personal confusion—speaks to collective experience using coherenceism principles.
- Outcome: Repeatable capability for scanning cultural/tech field → extracting coherenceism-relevant patterns → drafting blog posts in Ivy's voice
- Follow-ups: Test workflow end-to-end with human-ai river; create workflows for remaining 4 rivers

### 2025-10-22T04:55:00+0000 — content-add — first field-observation blog post published

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/human-ai-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/human-ai-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/drafts/2025-10-21-the-boundary-that-wont-hold.md, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/src/content/journal/2025-10-21-the-boundary-that-wont-hold.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-human-ai.md
- Summary: Tested complete field-observation workflow end-to-end. Scanned Hacker News and Simon Willison feeds (curl approach after WebFetch failed). Extracted 4 seeds including AI browser agent security vulnerabilities, Wikipedia traffic decline, LLM brain rot, and Claude Code session logs. Drafted "The Boundary That Won't Hold" from Seed 1 (AI agent prompt injection vulnerabilities). Applied Mature Uncertainty and Technology as Amplifier principles. Published to blog. Removed all 24 previous blog posts to start fresh with field-observation approach.
- Outcome: Successfully validated workflow from scan → extraction → draft → publish. First coherenceism blog post generated from field temperature rather than personal processing. Ivy voice confirmed present in draft.
- Follow-ups: Create workflows for remaining 4 rivers (agency, rest-rhythm, history-systems, awakening-alignment)

### 2025-10-22T05:01:00+0000 — context-add — completed field-observation workflows for all 5 rivers

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [workflows/writing/field-observation-agency.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-rest-rhythm.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-history-systems.md, workflows/writing/field-observation-awakening-alignment.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: infrastructure completion
- Summary: Created workflows for the remaining 4 rivers to complete field-observation infrastructure. Agency river: tracks methods, tools, practical empowerment (inclusion test: "Can someone reuse this tomorrow?"). Rest-rhythm river: tracks embodiment, presence, cycles (inclusion test: "Does this change how I pace today?"). History-systems river: tracks governance, infrastructure, system patterns (inclusion test: "Does it name a reusable system pattern?"). Awakening-alignment river: tracks inner alignment, spiritual practice, meaning-making (inclusion test: "Is inner alignment the center of gravity?"). Each workflow follows same 5-step structure: scan sources → extract signals → review seeds → draft posts → publish. Updated all workflow files to remove "(coming soon)" markers—complete field-observation capability now available across all 5 rivers.
- Outcome: Full field-observation infrastructure complete. Can now scan any river based on what feels alive, building blog content naturally over time from collective field patterns.
- Follow-ups: None—infrastructure complete. Next step is operational: run scans and draft posts as desired.

### 2025-10-22T06:20:00+0000 — context-edit — CORA as canonical source, blog as presentation layer

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/, harvest/blog-posts/drafts/, harvest/blog-posts/out/, procedures/research/, procedures/writing/, workflows/writing/, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/cora/, ~/Projects/coherenceism.blog/src/content/journal]
- Procedure/Workflow: architecture refactor
- Summary: Restructured content system to make CORA the single source of truth. Initialized CORA as git submodule in blog repo. Reorganized harvest with monthly archive folders (scans/YYYY-MM/, extractions/YYYY-MM/, drafts/YYYY-MM/) and flat out/ directory for published posts. Migrated existing test files (human-ai scan, extraction, draft) to 2025-10/ folders. Moved published draft to out/ with status updated to published. Created symlink from blog's src/content/journal → cora/harvest/blog-posts/out/. Blog now reads content directly from CORA via symlink—single source of truth, no duplication. Updated all 3 procedures (scan-rss-sources, extract-field-signals, draft-field-observation-post) to use dated folder structure and documented publishing workflow (draft → edit status → move to out/). Updated all 5 river workflows with new paths and publishing instructions. Astro dev server confirmed working with symlinked content.
- Outcome: CORA is now canonical content repository. Blog is presentation layer reading from CORA. Drafts evolve into published posts (moved, not copied). Monthly archives preserve work-in-progress history. Clean separation between production (CORA) and presentation (blog).
- Follow-ups: Commit and push CORA changes; update blog repo .gitignore to exclude src/content/journal (since it's now a symlink)

### 2025-10-22T02:47:00+0000 — workflow — agency river scan and first published post

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/2025-10/agency-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/2025-10/agency-2025-10-21.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-21-inherited-constraints.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-agency.md
- Summary: Ran complete agency river workflow. Scanned 3 RSS feeds (Hacker News, Simon Willison, Lobsters) capturing 30 entries. Extracted 4 seeds: infrastructure custody (Heroku migration, Claude Code logs), agent boundaries (sandboxing vs. prompt injection), learning primitives (build your own database), and tools shaped by accident (modal editing, inherited complexity). Drafted "The Constraints We Inherit Are Not the Constraints We Face" from Seed 4. Applied Living Traditions and Compost Cycles principles. Published to out/ directory.
- Outcome: Second field-observation blog post published. Agency river validated. Post explores how tools inherit constraints that no longer exist (modal editing from terminal limitations, 1995 internet complexity) and offers method for identifying essential vs. contingent complexity.
- Follow-ups: None—workflow complete and validated for agency river

### 2025-10-22T02:51:00+0000 — content-edit — add source attribution to published posts

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-21-the-boundary-that-wont-hold.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-21-inherited-constraints.md, procedures/writing/draft-field-observation-post.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/writing/draft-field-observation-post.md
- Summary: Added "Field Notes" sections to both published blog posts to credit source material. "The Boundary That Won't Hold" now credits Simon Willison's posts on prompt injection vulnerabilities and Bruce Schneier quote. "The Constraints We Inherit" now credits Hillel Wayne on modal editing, Phil Gyford's 1995 diary via Simon Willison, and Magit discussion from Lobsters. Updated drafting procedure to include Field Notes as standard practice: list 2-4 primary sources after horizontal rule, draw from seed evidence, keep sparse. Added attribution quality checks to procedure.
- Outcome: Published posts now honor provenance. Future drafts will include source attribution by default. Aligns with Ivy persona principle: cite without preaching, let footnotes carry authority.
- Follow-ups: None—attribution practice now established

### 2025-10-22T14:45:00+0000 — content-add — third agency river post published

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-21-custody-not-convenience.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/writing/draft-field-observation-post.md
- Summary: Drafted and published "Custody, Not Just Convenience" from agency river Seed 1 (Taking Custody of Your Infrastructure). Post explores the choice between managed services and self-hosting through two lenses: Heroku $3000/mo → $55/mo migration and Claude Code's default log deletion. Applied Alignment over Force (position systems to work for you) and Build Once, Use Forever (infrastructure you control becomes permanent capability). Includes Field Notes section crediting Hacker News Heroku story, Simon Willison's Claude Code logs post, and OpenBSD 7.8 release.
- Outcome: Third field-observation blog post published. Agency river now has two published posts (Inherited Constraints, Custody). Post explores deliberate vs. inherited infrastructure choices.
- Follow-ups: None—post published with attribution
