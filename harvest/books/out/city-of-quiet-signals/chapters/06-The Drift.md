# Chapter
Fatigue turns patterns into superstition. Mara miscounted twice in the same aisle and snapped at a stapler that refused to staple. Jae stopped answering for a day and then two. Someone she didn’t trust said he’d flipped, and she felt the rumor move through her like an old draft.

The city wore concerts the way a river wears rain — more of the same noise, just more. Fireworks populated the sky with cheap punctuation. Every small sound she’d taught herself to notice came wrapped in ten big ones, and she could feel her muscles overcorrecting, then giving up.

On the green line she took a seat and decided to do nothing. The decision was not elegant. It asked her to sit with the itch to be useful while trains pretended to be rivers and announcements lied about delays. She watched a child count tiles with a finger on the window. The finger missed one and the world did not end.

She unfolded the map a stranger had once tapped and laid it on her bag. The blank corridor she’d boxed weeks ago looked slightly wrong now, like a healed scar that remembered a different shape. She added a line a centimeter longer and felt the adjustment click in her wrist. The move cost nothing. It felt like something that might pay.

At home she drank water and slept for nine hours without a plan. When she woke, the urge to move returned the way power returns: a light settling into steady hum. She looked at her card and the corridor’s extension looked inevitable, as if she’d simply caught up to what the paper already knew.
