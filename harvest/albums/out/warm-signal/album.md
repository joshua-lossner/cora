# Inspiration

A country‑soul set for long two‑lane drives and kitchen‑table evenings. Warm tape‑soft edges, a steady backbeat, and a small choir of friends on the choruses. Each song carries one branch of Coherenceism into the body: alignment you can feel in your chest, an ethics you can hum. Guitar glows, organ breathes, and the rhythm section leaves space for the words to land.

# Concept

Nine songs trace Coherenceism from wide‑field seeing to daily practice: awareness, composted endings, aligned action, and neighborly care. The sonic palette stays human and analog—Wurli, Hammond, clean guitar, and a rhythm section that leaves air. A quiet three‑note resonance motif threads the record: hinted in the opener, harmonized mid‑sequence, and sung back by the choir in the closer.

# Tracklist
1. Wide Open Mind — seeing the web we’re already in
2. Passing Through — compost cycles at every scale
3. Lean with the Line — alignment over force
4. Stay with the Note — quiet, alert attention
5. Do the Next True Thing — ethics as daily practice
6. Neighbor Light — community rituals and care
7. Teach the Wire to Sing — humane technology
8. Deep Quiet Wonder — mystery held with precision
9. The Living Line — small threads that endure

# Notes
- Keep vocals present and conversational; phrasing slightly behind the beat.
- Acoustic spaces over synthetic tails; let the room do the lifting.
- Repeat a quiet three‑note “resonance” tag at the end of a few tracks.
