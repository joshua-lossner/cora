# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Soft count‑in implied; Rhodes sets chords]

[Head A]
[Clean guitar states the theme]

[Head B]
[Guitar and Rhodes intertwine]

[Solo 1]
[Guitar — melodic lines, no rush]

[Solo 2]
[Tenor sax — gentle authority]

[Head A]
[Theme returns, smaller]

[Outro]
[A single, confident cadence]
