# Agents — Departments

## Purpose
Organize agents into purpose-led departments with clear charters, interfaces, and SOPs to increase coherence and reduce handoff friction.

## Conventions
- Department folder: `agents/<department>/`
- Department entry: `agents/<department>/COHERENCE.md`
- Agent files: `agents/<department>/<agent-name>.md`
- SOPs: `agents/<department>/sops/*.md`
- Templates: `agents/_templates/*`

## Available Departments (Trunk Minimal)
- philosophy — Principles, alignment, ontology stewardship
- research — Signals, synthesis to inspire content
- content — Seeds/leaves writing, editing, releases

## Notes
- Trunk stays minimal. Add departments only when a persistent need emerges.
- Keep COHERENCE.md brief; put actionable detail in SOPs.
- Link to `context/methodologies/*` and `procedures/*` where relevant.

## Validation
- See `procedures/validate-agents.md` (procedure) to check structure and metadata.
