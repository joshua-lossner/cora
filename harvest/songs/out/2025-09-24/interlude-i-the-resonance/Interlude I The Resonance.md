# Inspiration

A reflective pause between larger songs — a meditation on resonance itself: tones expanding into space, presence over motion, breath over beat.

# Style Prompt

Minimalist progressive interlude. Sparse textures, long sustains, and an emphasis on resonance over rhythm. Begin with a Tibetan bowl sample and ambient drones; add sparse guitar harmonics and bass swells, with subtle synth pads creating depth. Vocals are mostly spoken reflections and faint wordless hums, layered like overtones. No full percussion — only minimal cymbal washes. End with a single sustained tone fading into silence. Mood: meditative, spacious, transitional. Length: 1–2 minutes. Purpose: a reflective pause between larger songs.

# Lyrics

[Intro – Tibetan bowl tone fades in, layered with low drone and faint static crackle]

[Spoken, soft, spacious]
A single tone…
expands.
It does not fight the air.
It fills it.

[Instrumental – 1:00 to 1:30]

[Closing – instruments fade to silence, only the bowl tone lingers]
[Whispered]
Alignment is listening.
