# Task — Research OpenAI Platform Overview

## Purpose
Survey OpenAI’s current development surfaces (Chat/Responses, Assistants/Agent Workflows, Realtime/Voice, Tool Calling), auth patterns, rate limits, pricing signals, and SDK ergonomics. Capture implications for the app.

## Steps
1) Catalog capabilities and recommended paths (Assistants/Workflows vs. plain Chat/Responses).
2) Note streaming patterns for text, tool calls, and audio.
3) Summarize auth, org/project scoping, and key management.
4) Record rate limits/cost ranges for expected usage patterns.
5) Produce a short decision brief with links and trade-offs.

## Acceptance
- A concise brief committed at `context/documentation/openai/platform-overview.md:1` with sections: Surfaces, Streaming, Auth, Limits, Cost, Recommendations. ✔

## Roles
- Project Manager — `context/roles/project-manager.md:1`
- Backend Engineer — `context/roles/backend-engineer.md:1`

## Notes
- Keep this vendor-specific doc small and practical; the app remains provider-adapter driven.
