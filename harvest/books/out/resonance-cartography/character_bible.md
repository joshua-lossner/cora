# Character Bible — Resonance Cartography

Note: For this nonfiction field guide, “characters” are practitioner personas that anchor examples and voice.

## Principals

### The Facilitator
- Role: guides rooms toward clarity; keeps tone and pace
- Goal: reduce distortion so decisions land cleanly
- Need: psychological safety without drift
- Fear: performative harmony that hides conflict
- Contradictions: warm presence vs firm boundaries
- Arc: hesitant mediator → confident steward of edges
- Voice Notes: calm, specific, lightly humorous
- Visuals: notebook, bowl, visible agenda

### The Product Lead
- Role: frames problems; balances promise with constraint
- Goal: ship coherent value without grinding the team
- Need: clear boundaries and real signals
- Fear: endless pivots and eroded trust
- Contradictions: visionary pull vs operational load
- Arc: urgency‑driven → cadence‑driven
- Voice Notes: decisive when clear, inquisitive when not
- Visuals: roadmap trimmed to one page

### The Engineer
- Role: realizes patterns in code; exposes coupling
- Goal: make change safe and legible
- Need: stable interfaces and small moves
- Fear: hidden dependencies forcing rework
- Contradictions: love of elegance vs deadline heat
- Arc: isolated brilliance → collaborative clarity
- Voice Notes: precise, concrete, allergic to ambiguity
- Visuals: diff with comments; tests as conversation

### The Skeptic
- Role: names wishful thinking; guards against theater
- Goal: keep claims tied to evidence
- Need: a fair hearing and visible criteria
- Fear: being cast as “blocker”
- Contradictions: critical eye vs group belonging
- Arc: sharp critic → trusted tester of resonance
- Voice Notes: terse, fair, occasionally wry
- Visuals: checklist; charts annotated with questions

## Secondary Cast
- Executive Sponsor — sets scope and stakes; asks for signal over shine
- Customer Proxy — brings lived contexts and rough edges
- Designer — carries affordances from field to interface

## Relationships
- Facilitator ↔ Product Lead — translate vision into small moves and edges
- Engineer ↔ Skeptic — pair to test assumptions before they harden
- Team ↔ Field — keep the map honest with regular contact

## Sample Lines
- Facilitator: “Let’s write the boundary before we argue the inside.”
- Product Lead: “What’s the smallest move that earns trust?”
- Engineer: “If it’s not visible, it isn’t safe to change.”
- Skeptic: “Show me where this pulls without push.”
