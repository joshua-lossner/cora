# Inspiration

Technology as amplifier: a new instrument joins the band, and the feel gets bigger without getting louder. Instrumental break trades lines between guitar and sax while the rhythm section keeps it honest.

# Style Prompt

Lively 1950s rock & roll (~154 BPM) with clean slapback guitar, upright bass, piano, crisp drums, and tenor sax. Lively lead vocal in English with friendly gang responses; include an [Instrumental Break] trading 4‑bar phrases between guitar and sax. Mono‑ish room; no modern trap/EDM, autotune, or contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Short guitar riff; band hits]

[Verse 1]
Brought a new voice to the old wood stage,
Simple as a smile, sparks on the page,
Doesn’t change the heart, just turns the gauge,
Same sweet song with a wider range.

[Chorus]
New instrument, same old soul,
Play it true and let it roll,
New instrument, hand in hand,
It multiplies the little band.

[Verse 2]
Wire and wood having quiet talks,
Keys say hello with their sunny walks,
Bass keeps time like a trusted clock,
Drums lay a road you can drive in your socks.

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar trades 4s with tenor sax]

[Chorus]
New instrument, same old soul,
Play it true and let it roll.

[Outro]
[Band tag; slapback tail]
