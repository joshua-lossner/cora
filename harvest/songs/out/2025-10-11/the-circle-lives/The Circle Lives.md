# Inspiration

Cookouts, open mics, the Saturday market — people reading the same cues and adjusting in real time. Rituals that keep a scene alive. Hook as a call‑and‑response chant; leave space for the crowd.

# Style Prompt

1990s boom‑bap at 96 BPM; communal, uplifting mood; jazz/soul loop with horn hits; punchy kick+snare; subtle G‑funk bass color; chant‑ready hook. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Outro. Vocals: assertive lead with room for group chant on hook. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy risers, heavy autotune; keep vocal upfront; dynamic master.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Crowd ambience; handclaps on 2 and 4]

[Verse 1]
It ain’t one man’s crown — it’s a table with some seats,
Pass a plate, pass a story, pass a rhythm to the beat.
OGs nod at new kids, new kids listen, then they speak,
We protect the little rituals that keep the circle deep.
If you learned the secret handshake, it was eye contact and care,
Pick the mic up when you’re ready, leave your pride out on the stairs.
When we lose a voice, we echo it till someone finds their own,
Not a freeze in marble statues — this tradition lives and grows.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Verse 2]
Market blooms on Saturday, the band plays something loose,
Someone sets a crate for babies so they hear a different truth.
Every nod is like a downbeat, every smile a small refrain,
It’s not rules, it’s resonances that keep us all in lane.
I’ve seen leaders without titles, I’ve seen titles with no weight —
The former fix the feedback, the latter argue at the gate.
We’re repairing what we’re given with the tools that we can use,
That’s the kind of live tradition no bureaucracy can bruise.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Verse 3]
Every cypher on the corner is a tiny parliament,
Not the laws, but listening — that’s the real establishment.
Bring your best and take your losses; either way we clap it up,
’Cause belonging is a practice, not a trophy or a cup.
If we want the scene tomorrow, then we feed it now and here,
Open hands and open schedules — help each other volunteer.
When the record hits the ending, we don’t panic that it ends —
We flip it, find the sample, let the theme return again.

[Chorus]
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
We move as one, that’s how the culture lives.
The circle lives! (Lives!) The chorus gives! (Gives!)
Your voice, my voice — listen how the rhythm lifts.

[Outro]
[Group chant fades with claps]
