# Field Extraction — History-Systems — 2025-10-25

## Seed 1: When Counting Replaces Witnessing

### Pattern
Systems lean on metrics to manage complexity. When counts stand in for attention to lived conditions, legitimacy thins: governance signals drift from ground truth while administrators optimize dashboards instead of care.

### Tension
How far can institutions rely on aggregate metrics before trust collapses because nobody feels seen by the system that counts them?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Field Stewardship — Measurement shapes the shared field; bad measures distort, good measures clarify what needs attention.
- Secondary: Nested Coherence — Local realities must remain legible within national metrics; if the nesting fails, legitimacy erodes.

### Evidence
- It's the deadliest year for people in ICE custody in decades (NPR)
- Chess body investigating ex-world champion who accused Daniel Naroditsky of cheating (NPR)

### River Fit
Names a reusable governance pattern: measurement substituting for presence, with system legitimacy as the consequence.

## Seed 2: Fragile Archives as Infrastructure

### Pattern
Societies act as if narrative continuity is a given; in practice, archives are partial, lossy, and shaped by accidents of preservation.

### Tension
What policies preserve coherence over time when most stories won’t stay whole?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Living Traditions — Let forms adapt while protecting patterns; accept loss, but cultivate durable carriers.
- Secondary: Mature Uncertainty — Confidence in what survives; humility about gaps and projections.

### Evidence
- Yet the hunt for the world's oldest stories is not exactly triumphant (MetaFilter)

### River Fit
Treats cultural memory as information infrastructure; shows maintenance burden and failure modes across time.

## Seed 3: Legitimacy on Trial, Everywhere

### Pattern
From sports bodies to state agencies, adjudication processes become the story; when procedure loses credibility, the institution’s outputs are doubted by default.

### Tension
How do institutions rebuild trust when their internal courts are no longer believed?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Alignment over Force — Process must earn trust through clarity; coercion and opacity accelerate decay.
- Secondary: Field Stewardship — Public reasoning is part of the system; treat it as a first-class object.

### Evidence
- Chess body investigating ex-world champion who accused Daniel Naroditsky of cheating (NPR)

### River Fit
Classic history-systems theme: institutional trust cycles and the maintenance cost of legitimacy.
