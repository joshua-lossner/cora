# Chapter
Governance isn’t power; it’s stewardship of irreversible decisions. Resonant governance keeps the lightest mode that keeps people safe: consent for reversible moves, advice for adjacent edges, mandate for coupled, irreversible changes with evidence and appeals. You publish decision records in human words so the field can live with them.

Modes — Choose the Lightest That Works
- Consent: reversible, contained; decide unless a reasoned objection; learn by doing
- Advice: touches neighbors; invite adjacent edges; integrate clarity, not vetoes
- Mandate: irreversible, coupled; bring evidence; time‑box; appeals path required

Evidence — Packs That Don’t Grind
Pack contents (one screen)
- KNOW/INFER/IMAGINE bullets (risk + coupling)
- Map snapshot (where the dot lives)
- Ledger rows (hum/retune)
- Boundary proposal (IN/OUT/mode/owner/clock)
- Past‑tense line (draft) with why
No decks. Receipts.

Decision Records — Past Tense, With Why
You write decisions in past tense and in human words at the top of the doc that people actually open. “We added a permission clock and an appeals link because partners felt like a wall.” You link artifacts and the evidence pack. You keep adjectives off the line.

Appeals — Without Shame
- Publish how to appeal in human words; give a clock
- Require receipts, not rhetoric; invite two images
- Keep tone kind; appeals teach stewardship where constraints hurt

Periodic Tests — Governance Drift
- Check if mandates are rare and evidenced
- Check if consent covers most decisions; advice respected
- Check if decision lines exist and read human
- Check if appeals get answered and teach
Governance exists to reduce harm and friction; if it increases either, retune.

Cases — Mandates That Helped
- Incident containment: mandate with evidence; decision line every 30 minutes; appeals path after containment
- Data retention: mandate scope with evidence; consent for copy changes; appeals path for edge cases
- Security posture: mandate minimal viable change with “Because…” copy; consent for UI hints; appeals link in declines

Anti‑Patterns — Governance That Grinds
- Mandate masquerading as consent; people resist silently
- Evidence as theater; packs heavier than the decision
- Appeals as performance; “submit a ticket” to a void
Retune: name mandate; shrink scope; add a real appeals clock and past‑tense lines.

Templates — Copy/Paste
Decision Record (doc header)
```
Decision (past): We <did> <what> because <why>.
Owner <name>  Clock <date/time>  Links <artifact>
Appeals: <human‑word path with clock>
```

Evidence Pack (one screen)
```
KNOW/INFER/IMAGINE
Map snapshot
Ledger rows
Boundary proposal
Past‑tense line (draft)
```

Appeals Note (template)
```
We decided <…> because <…>.
If this caused harm or missed a constraint, here’s how to appeal: <path> (respond by <date>).
Please include two images (micro/macro) and one link to evidence.
```

Transcripts — Calm Decisions
PM: “Consent to ship ‘Next + Why’ on two pages; advice: Docs/Support.”
Compliance: “Mandate for permission clock copy; evidence attached; appeals path in decline email.”
Leader: “Decision lines at top by Thursday; receipts required. Done.”

Metrics — Signs of Resonance
- % consent vs advice vs mandate (target: consent majority)
- Evidence packs that fit one screen (target: most)
- Appeals answered on time (target: all)
- Decision records with links (target: all)
- Harm reports reduced (trend)

Q&A — Hard and Useful
- “Won’t this slow us down?” Only where harm lives. Elsewhere, consent speeds you up
- “What if appeals get noisy?” Respond with receipts; compost theater
- “How do we handle disagreement?” With edges and experiments; mandate later, small first

Leader’s Corner — Tone at the Top
- Demand receipts, not rhetoric; read decision lines, not decks
- Protect appeals; you own the clock
- Praise consent‑level learning; keep mandates rare and precise
Governance gets better when leaders enjoy small, evidenced motion more than grand performances.

Closing — Law With Breath
Resonant governance feels like safety and relief. People keep moving because the rails are honest and light. That is the only reason to have rails at all.
