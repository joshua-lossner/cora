# Suno v5 — Effective Style Prompt Writing

## Introduction

Suno AI’s version 5 (v5) is a text-to-music model that generates high‑quality songs from written prompts. With v5’s upgraded audio fidelity and stronger prompt understanding, the way you phrase your prompt directly affects the music it creates. This guide focuses on Suno v5—how it interprets prompts and how to structure your input for consistent results. By clearly specifying elements like mood, genre, instrumentation, tempo/BPM, lyrical themes, vocal style, language, and structure, you can steer v5 toward the song you imagine.

## How v5 Interprets Prompts

Suno v5 pays close attention to detail and handles nuanced descriptions of style and structure. Treat your text like a concise creative brief: name the genre (or a blend of two), emotional tone, signature instruments, tempo/energy, language for vocals, and any structural cues. Focused, unambiguous prompts generally yield more coherent results than sprawling, multi‑style descriptions.

## Key Elements of a Strong Prompt

- Mood & atmosphere: clear emotional adjectives (e.g., uplifting, somber, aggressive, dreamy).
- Genre & style: 1–2 genres/subgenres; era/scene descriptors are fine. Avoid specific artist names.
- Instrumentation & sound: a few signature instruments or production elements; avoid exhaustive lists.
- Tempo/BPM & energy: either a number (e.g., 128 BPM) or a range/descriptor (slow ballad, mid‑tempo groove).
- Structure & sections: optional cues like Intro → Build → Drop → Chorus; section tags if helpful.
- Vocals & language: on/off, voice style (male/female/duet/choir; gritty/sultry/breathy), and language.
- Negative constraints: what to exclude (e.g., no electric guitar, no heavy reverb).
- Optional format: structured (JSON‑like) prompts can reduce ambiguity when needed.

## Examples

Example 1 — Cinematic Southern Ballad

“Cinematic outlaw country, with bluesy pedal steel guitar and a raw, emotional atmosphere; ends as a cinematic southern soul ballad.”

Why it works: Blended style anchored by a key instrument and consistent mood; repeats “cinematic” to reinforce the arc.

Example 2 — EDM Track with Build and Drop

“A dreamy progressive house track at 128 BPM. Starts with airy pads and a soft beat, building with rising synth arpeggios. [Drop: heavy bass] with full drums and side‑chained chords, then an energetic, euphoric chorus.”

Why it works: Specifies genre, tempo, instrumentation, and a clear structure with a labeled drop.

Example 3 — JSON‑Formatted Prompt (Jazz‑Trap Fusion)

```
{"genre": "lofi jazz-trap", "mood": "chill yet dark", "elements": ["smooth saxophone riffs", "808 trap beat", "lo-fi piano samples"], "bpm": 85}
```

Why it works: Labels each component explicitly; the model gets a clear checklist.

Example 4 — Latin Pop with Spanish Lyrics

“An upbeat reggaeton‑pop song with Spanish lyrics. Mood: celebratory and romantic. Features Latin percussion (clave, shakers), a catchy synth hook, and female vocals with a sultry tone. Chorus: a sing‑along in Spanish that highlights the title phrase.”

Why it works: Calls out genre, language, mood, instrumentation, vocal quality, and chorus intent.

Example 5 — ’90s Grunge Rock with Solo

“A ’90s‑style grunge rock song, angsty and raw. Driven by distorted electric guitars, bass, and punchy drums. Male vocals with a gritty, yearning delivery. [Verse 1] brooding and soft; [Chorus] loud and explosive. Include a [Guitar Solo: 8s] after the second chorus. Lyrics reflect teenage disillusionment.”

Why it works: Nails era/genre, mood, band setup, dynamic section cues, and a short solo tag.

## Conclusion

Write prompts like concise production notes. Stick to 1–2 genres, choose vivid mood language, highlight a few signature sounds, set tempo/energy, add structural cues if needed, and be explicit about vocals and language. Keep references high‑level (genre/era/scene) rather than named artists, and use negatives for exclusions. Clarity and brevity (one to three sentences, or a small JSON) usually produce the best results.
