# Content Integration — Tasks

## Steps
1. Add a small Astro/Node loader for frontmatter + markdown
2. Filter by `sites` key; expose selectors for branches and seeds
3. Provide TypeScript types for loaded items
4. Publish as a tiny local package or shared util in each site

## Deliverables
- Loader function with tests (unit tests optional)
- Docs usage snippet in each site

## Notes
- Keep tight to the schema in `content/COHERENCE.md`.
