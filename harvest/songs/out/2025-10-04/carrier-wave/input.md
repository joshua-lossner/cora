# Inspiration

A dim practice room hums like a carrier wave, walls buzzing as if the whole city were an amp left on standby. We tune into the field under everything, letting feedback blur until it becomes one steady note we can ride. The verses push through static, tense and low; the chorus opens like air after rain, a raw shout that stays on pitch. Grime, rain‑slick concrete, sodium lights flicker; the room breathes with us. The song should feel like plugging our nerves straight into the universal line and letting it sing back.

# Notes (optional)

- Keep guitars thick and detuned; let chords ring and clash.
- Leave space between vocal lines; let the room tail carry emotion.
- Hook ideas: "we are the wire," "carrier wave is singing," "static into one tone."
- Keep production raw; avoid polished pop sheen; clip edges are okay if the feel lands.
