# Tools — Index

Purpose
- Collect vendor-neutral notes that help procedures operate tools consistently.

Examples
- Editor/formatting conventions, file naming, metadata keys
 - GitHub CLI — `context/tools/github-cli.md:1`

Notes
- Vendor-specific guides live under `context/documentation/` (e.g., `suno`, `elevenlabs`).
