# Task â€” Add Project Status Report Procedure

## Purpose
Create a read-only procedure that prints a terminal report of all projects and their task statuses (including git fields), to aid daily reviews.

## Steps
1) Add `procedures/project-management/report_status.md:1` with Operator Prompt.
2) Add to Project Manager role shortlist.
3) Validate by running a dry read of `context/projects/*.md` and `context/tasks/*/*.md`.

## Acceptance
- Procedure exists; Project Manager loads it; output shape is human-scannable.

## Links
- `procedures/project-management/report_status.md:1`
- `context/roles/project-manager.md:1`
