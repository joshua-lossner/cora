# Task â€” Accessibility + Tests

## Purpose
Ensure the TUI shell and components are accessible (keyboard focus, contrast) and reasonably tested (snapshots/unit for key logic).

## Steps
1) Add focus-visible styles and ensure contrast meets targets.
2) Add snapshot tests for components (Ink testing utilities) and unit tests for palette logic.
3) Document keyboard coverage and limitations.

## Acceptance
- Basic tests pass; focus and contrast reviewed; docs updated accordingly.

## Roles
- QA/Release; UI Engineer
