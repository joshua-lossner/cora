### 2025-10-09T14:35:00-05:00 — context-edit — renamed UI hub and moved fruit into harvest/

- Actor: s_vektor
- Paths: [context/projects/coherenceism-org.md, context/projects/COHERENCE.md, harvest/COHERENCE.md, context/documentation/cora/knowledge-tree.md]
- Summary: Reframed coherenceism.ui as coherenceism.org (shared artifact hub) and renamed `content/` to `harvest/`, updating rails to treat artifacts as fruit stored centrally.
- Outcome: Domain naming matches role of the hub; harvest/ is now the canonical store for shared essays, songs, and other outputs.
