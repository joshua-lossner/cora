# Task — Research OpenAI Advanced Voice & Realtime

## Purpose
Understand text→audio and live Realtime APIs: session setup, audio codecs, server/client WebSocket flows, latency, and browser integration constraints.

## Steps
1) Review Realtime session creation and auth (server-issued tokens), media tracks, and event model.
2) Compare server- vs. client-side streaming; pick a secure approach.
3) Identify recommended audio formats (e.g., 24kHz PCM, mp3/opus) and browser playback patterns.
4) Outline the minimal client: mic capture → WS → stream playback; and text-only TTS path.
5) Capture example requests and error behaviors.

## Acceptance
- Notes committed at `context/documentation/openai/voice-realtime.md:1` including a minimal sequence diagram and security notes. ✔

## Roles
- Media Producer — `context/roles/media-producer.md:1`
- Backend Engineer — `context/roles/backend-engineer.md:1`

## Notes
- Defer final voice selection; focus on safe session/token patterns and playback UX.
