# Inspiration
Endings rearrange, not erase. Gentle clap groove, tender verses, a strong chorus vow, and a comforting post‑chorus line repeating “never disappears.”

# Notes (optional)
Anchor with sub‑bass warmth; add falsetto harmonies on chorus phrases.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band pop at 100 BPM. Clap/snare pop groove, glossy pads, clean guitar sparkle, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked harmonies with falsetto lifts. Chorus vows “never disappears”; soft post‑chorus reassurance. No heavy EDM drops or harsh distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Clap/snare groove; soft pad]

[Verse 1]
Old photos in a drawer, dust in the light,
We try to close the book, but it reads us tonight.
Every word we whispered still hangs in the air—
Turn the page, it’s still there.

[Pre‑Chorus]
If it changes shape, it’s not the end,
We carry it forward, around the bend.

[Chorus]
It never disappears,
It just moves into place.
It turns into the thread
That still ties our days.

[Verse 2]
Keys left in a bowl, names on the wall,
The quiet of the kitchen when we’ve said it all.
In the hum of the fridge, I hear a vow—
Not gone, just here somehow.

[Bridge]
[Pads bloom; harmony stack]
What we love becomes the light we steer by,
Not a ghost—just a clearer sky.

[Chorus]
It never disappears,
It just moves into place.
It turns into the thread
That still ties our days.

[Post‑Chorus]
Still here, still here—never disappears.

[Outro]
[Falsetto ad‑libs over pad]
