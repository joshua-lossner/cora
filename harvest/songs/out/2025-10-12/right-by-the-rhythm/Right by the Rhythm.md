# Inspiration

Ethics as timing: do the right thing on the downbeat. Verses show small choices in motion; the chorus declares “right by the rhythm” as a way of moving together.

# Style Prompt

1950s rock & roll shuffle at ~152 BPM with clean twang guitar (slapback), upright bass slap, boogie‑woogie piano, ride/shuffle drums, and bright gang responses. Confident lead vocal in English; compact [Guitar Solo] before the final hook. Keep mono‑style space; exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Count‑in; piano walk‑up]

[Verse 1]
Tip your hat, hold the door, mind the town,
Pay your debts, say the truth, lay it down,
Little right moves keep the big wheel sound,
Do it on the beat when the heart comes round.

[Chorus]
Right by the rhythm — that’s how we do,
Right by the rhythm — me and you,
When the world starts pushin’, we don’t push too,
We move in time till the light shines through.

[Verse 2]
Share your stage, count it fair, make it plain,
Own your miss, fold it back like rain,
Neighbors clap, feet reply the same,
Pocket got a code and it knows your name.

[Guitar Solo]
[Twangy 8 bars]

[Chorus]
Right by the rhythm — that’s how we do,
Right by the rhythm — me and you.

[Outro]
[Short tag on the chorus line]
