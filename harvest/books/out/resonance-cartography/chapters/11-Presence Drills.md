- Hold a “two images” rule for abstract points.
- Close loops the same day; reduce echoes.
- Protect two hours weekly for deep coherence work.

# Chapter
Presence is infrastructure. You don’t need incense or a mountain. You need a breath, a sentence, a wall you can touch, and a clock that belongs to you. Presence Drills make attention practical: small moves for your nervous system so the field can carry the work.

Why drills? Because attention leaks through holes you pretend not to see: haste, vanity, fear, habit. Because your body learns faster than your plans. Because a minute given to presence saves an hour of drift.

One‑Breath Reset (before starts; after conflicts)
You begin with the smallest unit. One clean inhale until the shoulders lift; one exhale until your face softens. Name the work in seven words or fewer (“reduce dead ends in onboarding”). If you can’t name it, you can’t do it. Place your hands on something solid: a table edge, a notebook, the wall. Attention loves edges.

Counter‑Habit (name your default distortion; choose the opposite move)
Default distortions: speed, status, certainty, cleverness. You name the one that owns you. Then you pick a counter‑habit for a week. Speed → slow verbs. Status → write decisions in past tense. Certainty → add a probe. Cleverness → write two images. You post the counter‑habit at the top of your doc where embarrassment can help you keep it.

Two‑Images Rule (for any abstract point)
When talk floats, you ask for two images: micro (“what a person does next”) and macro (“what the team or system does as a result”). You don’t move without two images. If the room resists, you write the images yourself and ask the room to correct them; correction is easier than invention.

Close Loops the Same Day (reduce echoes)
The mind holds unpaid debts loudly. You write three loops at noon and three at 4 p.m. “Post decision line.” “Send screenshot.” “Book 30m for map snapshot.” You close them before you stop. If you can’t, you write the past‑tense line you intend to make true tomorrow and stop. Presence is allowed to end.

Protect Two Hours Weekly (deep coherence)
You block two hours when you won’t perform for anyone. You read the sentence at the top of your doc. You add one map snapshot. You write one boundary. You draft one procedure, even if you delete it later. You end with one ledger row and a walk. These hours change the week because they remove fiction from the rails.

Method — Five Core Drills (repeatable; stackable)
1) Breath + Sentence (60–90 seconds)
   - Inhale; exhale; speak the work in Tuesday words. Put hands on a surface. Read your own voice out loud.
2) Two‑Image Test (90 seconds)
   - Write one micro image and one macro image. “A new hire clicks without asking.” “The weekly report shows fewer ‘where do I…?’s.”
3) Edge Touch (3 minutes)
   - Draw IN/OUT; pick mode; owner/clock; write past‑tense line now. If nothing is decidable, move to map; if still fog, schedule a probe.
4) Ledger Line (2 minutes)
   - Name the hum; choose one retune; paste a link; write the past‑tense line for last week.
5) Loop Sweep (3 minutes)
   - List three loops; close them; schedule one that needs tomorrow; stop.

Body Checks — What Alignment Feels Like
- Breath smooths; jaw unclenches; shoulders drop 1 cm
- Sentences get shorter; nouns become actions; slogans vanish
- People look at the same object; hands quiet; voices lower
If your body disagrees, your plan is a story. Drill; then decide.

Micro‑Drills (10–60 seconds)
- Two‑count pause before speaking; ask “image?” instead of argument
- Read one decision line in past tense; if you wince, rewrite
- Put a finger on the screen where the next link goes; paste it
- Stand; touch the wall; breathe; sit; name the work
- Turn camera off for one minute to write two images; turn back on

Calendar Hooks (where drills live)
- Before every meeting: breath + sentence
- After conflicts: breath + edge touch (“what’s decidable?”)
- At handoffs: two images + link + owner/clock
- Weekly: two hours for map + boundary + ledger
- Friday: harvest (three keeps; three changes; one procedure; next planting)

Remote Variant (rectangles with delay)
You name delay and split attention explicitly: the distortion today. You open with 60 seconds of silence and the sentence. You ask people to paste two images before they talk. You run a 90‑second round of breath + one line (“clear / strain”). You forbid stacked applause until the decision line is written.

Default Distortion Drill (choose one; run for a week)
- Speed → “slow verbs week”: start sentences with “we will…” less; write “we did…” more; edge touch before debate
- Status → “artifact week”: no “I agree” posts; only links; praise is for receipts in #wins
- Certainty → “probe week”: two probes; one fog shrinks; one dies; ledger rows prove it
- Cleverness → “plain week”: Tuesday words only; two images per abstract; delete metaphors unless they teach
You carry one card in your pocket with your week’s drill; you mark tallies because tallies turn wishes into practice.

Case — Presence After a Spill
Post‑incident, the room wants blame or miracles. You run Breath + Sentence + Edge Touch. “Contain impact to X; restore Y; decision lines every 30 minutes.” You add a ledger row. You write a single past‑tense line you intend to post. The room calms because you gave it rails. You didn’t “inspire”; you reduced strain.

Case — The Meeting That Kept Drifting
Every week, a “sync” wandered. You began with two images and an edge. You added a 60‑second silence before choosing. You ended with a past‑tense line. After three weeks, fewer people spoke and more people shipped. The meeting got smaller and then ended. Slack quieted; no one missed it.

Case — The Writing That Hid
You could not ship a doc because it did not say anything. You applied Two‑Images + Past‑Tense. You put “Sentence (Tuesday)” at the top. You wrote “Decision (past)” under it. You deleted paragraphs that didn’t feed those two lines. The doc became a page people used.

Anti‑Patterns — Presence as Theater
- Rituals with no decisions; breath as performance
- New tools that don’t change sentences or links
- “Mindfulness hour” that produces no relief
Retune: breath + sentence + edge + ledger. Presence is a means to movement, not an aesthetic.

Q&A — Skeptical and Practical
- “Isn’t this just meditation in a meeting?” No. It’s attention applied to decision shape and rails. One minute buys back hours of drift.
- “What if my team rolls their eyes?” Let them. Then ship a cleaner decision. Relief converts more than talk.
- “How do I keep this from getting corny?” Keep it short. Keep it tied to artifacts. Stop when clarity appears.

Drills by Role
- PM: breath + sentence; write edge; ledger row; end early
- Eng: two images for risk; past‑tense line in PR; rollback note
- Design: two images of success; hint at hesitation; screenshot proof
- Support: one explain‑why; one triage ‘Next’; quote of ease
- Ops: visible clocks; meeting deletes; ledger discipline
- Legal/Compliance: human‑word constraints; appeals link; 10‑minute consults with past‑tense notes

Integrations — Where Drills Interlock
- Breath + sentence → edges (Chapter 4)
- Two images → signals and maps (Chapters 3, 6)
- Loop sweep → rhythm ledger (Chapter 8)
- Counter‑habit → harvest (Chapter 7)
Presence is the conductor; the orchestra is the rails. You do not conduct long; you bring them in and stop.

Accessibility & Presence
- Allow note‑writing time; cameras optional during silence
- Provide alt text and readable fonts; cognitive load is tone too
- Read a past‑tense line aloud for screen‑reader users to anchor
Presence includes bodies that move and read differently.

Leader’s Corner — Set Tone, Then Disappear
Leaders who crave control perform presence loudly. Don’t. Enter, breathe, name the sentence, remove one friction, call consent, assign owner/clock, demand past‑tense lines, and leave. You’re not the bowl; you’re the person who rings it once.

Metrics That Matter (for this chapter)
- Meetings that end early due to clarity
- Decision records written in past tense
- Two‑image compliance (abstract points paired with micro/macro)
- Loop closures/day; smaller backlog; fewer echoes
- Two hours protected/week for deep coherence work

Scripts — When the Room Heats
- “Pause. Breath. Now the sentence.”
- “Two images; then we move.”
- “What’s decidable here? Draw the box.”
- “Owner/clock. Past‑tense line.”
- “Stop when clarity appears.”

Remote Scripts — Kind and Firm
- “Typing for 60 seconds; paste two images.”
- “Paste a link or say ‘no link.’ We can’t steer without it.”
- “Consent for this; mandate later with evidence.”
- “Past‑tense line by Thursday; screenshot attached.”

Workshop — Presence Lab (30 minutes)
1) Breath + sentence (2m)
2) Two images (5m)
3) Edge touch (5m)
4) Ledger line (5m)
5) Loop sweep (5m)
6) Read one past‑tense line aloud (3m)
7) Stop (no applause)

Personal Practice — Morning/Noon/Evening
- Morning: breath + sentence; one counter‑habit tally
- Noon: two images for the hardest task; one loop closed
- Evening: harvest your day; write one procedure; set tomorrow’s sentence

Reading Your Own Tone
You listen to your voice read the two lines at the top of the doc. If you speed, slow. If you shrink words, expand. If you cannot read the lines without apology, your edge is wrong. Presence is not silence; it is honesty with a clock.

Closing — What Presence Sounds Like
It sounds like the room moving without you. It sounds like sentences that don’t ask for applause. It sounds like a quiet timer and the scrape of a chair and a pen that writes “We did…” at the top of a page. That’s the sound of work you can live with.

Extended Drills — 1m / 3m / 10m Sequences

1‑Minute Reset (solo or room)
- Breath (20s) — inhale/exhale once; relax the jaw
- Sentence (20s) — speak the work in ≤7 words
- Edge touch (20s) — write IN/OUT or decide “not decidable” and move to map

3‑Minute Clarity (before key choice)
- Breath + sentence (45s)
- Two images (45s) — micro + macro
- Past‑tense draft (45s)
- Owner/clock (45s)

10‑Minute Turn (for stuck moments)
- Breath + sentence (1m)
- Two images + map (3m)
- Edge touch (3m) — IN/OUT; mode; owner/clock; stop
- Ledger line (2m) — hum/retune/link
- Stop (1m) — if clarity appears, end early

Presence Kits — Keep One Nearby
- Review Kit: two images card; consent/advice/mandate cheatsheet; doc header snippet
- Incident Kit: decision (past) snippet; 30‑minute cadence table; rollback checklist
- Writing Kit: sentence + decision header; “two images” sticky; plain‑language checklist
- Facilitation Kit: timer; boundary template; resonance prompts (“clear/strain”)

Industry Caselets — Presence Across Fields
- Healthcare: breath + sentence before disclosing risk; “two images” for consent; decision line in patient’s chart
- Education: two‑minute quiet at start; “two images” for assignment; decision line in LMS “Announcements”
- Government: breath + sentence before public brief; past‑tense lines in status pages; “because…” copy instead of jargon
- Nonprofit: 60‑second quiet at board; decision lines in grants page; two images in volunteer onboarding

Role Dayplans — Presence You Can Keep
- PM: breath + sentence at 9:00; two images before specs; ledger line at 4:00; stop when clarity appears
- Eng: two images before PR; past‑tense line in merge message; loop sweep before end of day
- Design: breath before crit; two images per frame; screenshot receipts in doc; finish with a sentence
- Support: two images for FAQs; explain‑why in templates; ledger row Mondays; close loops after last shift
- Ops: breath before triage; replace ASAP with clocks; post weekly digest; delete one meeting

Presence Wall — A Page People Actually Use
Top: doc header snippet + “how to breathe + speak the sentence” (three lines). Middle: checklists for two images, edge touch, ledger line. Bottom: three anonymized past‑tense lines with links. Nothing abstract. The wall is a mirror, not a mural.

Equity (Deeper) — Sharing Attention on Purpose
- Round‑robins before open discussion; timeboxes visible
- Written starts: one minute to write images; then speak
- “Haven’t heard from…” prompts with warmth; no shaming
- Track talk time; adjust facilitation; publish the ratio once a month
Presence without equity is theater; presence with equity is relief.

Accessibility (Deeper)
- Read the two header lines aloud; provide captions
- Put the sentence in large type; high contrast; simple fonts
- Offer short written pauses instead of only spoken ones
- Keep screens calm; fewer animations; respect motion settings

More Scripts — What To Say When You Don’t Know
- “Let’s move what we can decide into a box.”
- “Two images before we argue.”
- “One friction to remove; then we try again.”
- “Consent now; mandate later with evidence.”
- “Past‑tense line on the doc by Thursday.”

Presence + Coaching — The Quiet Way to Teach
- Model once; no lecture; ask “what felt clear?”
- Give a pocket card; collect tallies for a week
- Review two past‑tense lines; ask “where did you breathe?”
- Celebrate stopping early when clarity appears

Retreat Drill — 30 Minutes to Reset a Team
1) Breath + sentence (3m)
2) Two images (5m)
3) Map five dots (5m)
4) Edge one decision (5m)
5) Write past‑tense + ledger line (5m)
6) Pick a counter‑habit for the week (5m)
Stop. Publish one page with three receipts. The retreat worked if people breathe later in the week without you.

Measurement — Presence Without Policing
- Seconds of quiet before decisions (target: 30–60s)
- Decision lines written (count/week)
- Two‑image compliance (yes/no on major decisions)
- Loops closed/day (trend)
- Felt clarity poll (1–5; optional; anonymized)
Numbers exist to keep the habit alive, not to grade personalities.

Default Distortion Cards — Examples
- Speed card: “Slow verbs; write the past‑tense line first.”
- Status card: “Receipts over ‘I agree’ posts; link or hush.”
- Certainty card: “Two probes; ledger rows; fog shrinks or composts.”
- Cleverness card: “Plain words; two images; metaphors only if they teach.”
Each card has a tally area; fill five circles/day; share a photo Friday.

Presence in Hiring and Onboarding
- Interviews: give 60 seconds of writing; ask for two images, not a pitch
- Trials: ask candidates to write a decision line; note cadence and clarity
- Onboarding: teach the doc header and two images in week one; require one past‑tense line
You hire presence when you hire people who write receipts.

Presence + Conflict — Lower the Heat, Keep the Truth
- Name the tone: “We’re in strain.”
- Add time: “60 seconds writing; two images.”
- Narrow scope: draw IN/OUT; owner/clock
- Keep dignity: “We will pause; post a past‑tense line; return with receipts.”

Coaching Questions — End of Week Circle
- “Where did presence reduce strain?”
- “Which drill helped — breath, images, edge, ledger, loops?”
- “What did we stop doing that returned attention?”
- “Where did we stop early?”

Final Coda — Attention, With Edges
Presence isn’t a mood. It’s attention shaped by rails. Breathe, name, picture, bound, log. Then let the room carry itself. That is the practice.

Posters & Cards — Tiny Artifacts to Keep
- Wallet card: Breath/Sentence • Two Images • Edge • Ledger • Loops
- Wall poster: Sentence + Decision lines in big type; two empty lines to fill
- Screen saver: “We did… because… (link)”
Presence is a muscle; these are bands you can carry.

Async Cookbook — Presence Without the Room
- Quiet start: post the sentence and two images at the top of a shared doc; invite 60 seconds of typed responses
- Link or hush: require a link (or write “no link”); move opinions to compost unless artifacts arrive
- Consent by comment: use ✅ to mark consent for reversible moves; time‑box dissent; collect advice for adjacent edges
- Past‑tense window: reserve a 15‑minute window where the owner will post the past‑tense line and screenshot; no thread applause
This turns asynchronous drift into asynchronous clarity with receipts.

Meeting Types — Presence Patterns You Can Reuse
- Standup (10m): breath + sentence (1m); three rows read silently (3m); one retune chosen (3m); past‑tense recall (2m); stop early
- Crit (30m): breath (1m); two images on screen (5m); one change per frame (15m); decision lines (5m); stop (4m)
- Planning (25m): breath (1m); map five dots (8m); edges (8m); ledger rows (6m); stop (2m)
Every meeting inherits presence drills in different shapes; keep the feel, not the form.

Presence Smells — Quick Diagnostics
- Chatter rises and artifacts vanish → add link or hush; paste receipts
- People repeat the problem in new words → read the sentence; freeze synonyms
- Jokes cover heat → two images in writing; then decide
- “We need alignment” without a move → draw the box; owner/clock; past‑tense draft
Presence is how you smell drift before it becomes theater.

Neurodiversity — Designing Presence for Different Minds
- Offer written starts; allow slow typing; keep prompts short and concrete
- Reduce sensory load: simple screens; no motion; optional cameras
- Use timers visibly but gently; count down with captions
- Invite “clear/strain” via form for those who prefer writing
Presence that includes more bodies produces better decisions and fewer apologies.

Personal Metrics — Help, Not Judgment
- “I wrote X decision lines this week” (count)
- “I ended Y meetings early” (count)
- “I posted Z receipts” (links)
- “I kept my counter‑habit N days” (tallies)
These numbers exist only to keep the practice alive; delete if they incite performance.

Parent/Child Variations — Teaching Presence at Different Scales
- One‑on‑one: breath; “what felt clear / what still strains?”; write a past‑tense line for one small move
- Team: drills as above
- Org‑wide: publish three past‑tense lines and one template; run a 10‑minute presence demo
Presence scales by shape, not by force.

Common Fears — And Reassurances
- “Silence will feel awkward.” It will, for two weeks. Then relief replaces it.
- “People will game the drills.” Past‑tense lines with links resist gaming.
- “We don’t have time.” You already spend the time; presence buys it back.
- “It’s corny.” So is applause. We cut both and keep receipts.

“Presence in Docs” — A Micro Guide
- Start every doc with the header; delete until it reads clean out loud
- Insert two images before any abstract section; delete abstractions without images
- Add a past‑tense line at decision points; keep links near the line, not in a footnote
- End with loops to close today (3); return tomorrow with one past‑tense line
Docs teach presence when they read like movement, not like memory.

Deeper Transcript — Resetting a Failing Review (5 minutes)
Leader: “We’re out of time—just ship.”
Facilitator: “Breath; sentence out loud: ‘reduce dead ends in onboarding.’ Now two images.”
Design: “A new hire clicks Next without asking.”
Eng: “We talk risk, not nits, in PRs.”
Facilitator: “Edge?”
PM: “IN: Start Here + Next/Why; OUT: onboarding overhaul. Mode: consent. Owner: PL. Clock: Thu.”
Facilitator: “Past‑tense line?”
PL: “We added Next/Why; hesitations fell.”
Facilitator: “Ledger row posted. Stop.”
Five minutes, one move, no sermon.

“Presence Debt” — Pay It Down Without Shame
- Day 1: add decision lines to two stale docs
- Day 2: add ‘Because…’ to one policy; appeals link
- Day 3: draw edges for two drifting decisions
- Day 4: post one ledger row; kill one meeting
- Day 5: harvest a messy week; write one procedure
In one week the body of the team will feel different; you’ll smell less heat.

Edge Cases — When Presence Feels Impossible
- Crisis mode: use mandate rails with evidence; keep drills to breath + sentence + decision line
- Interpersonal heat: name tone; switch to written two‑images; decide with an edge; follow up with a ledger
- Fatigue: end early; write the past‑tense you’ll make true tomorrow; protect sleep; presence returns with rest

Coaching — Teach Presence by Doing
- Ring the bowl once (or a phone chime). Don’t talk about breath; breathe
- Write the sentence; invite two images; draw the box
- Ask for owner/clock; write the past‑tense line together; stop early
People copy shapes they can feel; your job is to set the key.

Practice Prompts — End of Day
- “What sentence did I speak out loud?”
- “What image made a decision honest?”
- “What loop did I close?”
- “What friction did I remove?”
- “Where did I stop early?”

One More Coda — Attention Is Love With Edges
You don’t need to say it. You show it when you give attention boundaries to do its work. Breath, sentence, image, edge, ledger, loop. The field hears you even when you don’t speak.
