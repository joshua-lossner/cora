# Beats
- Jae shows micro-gesture syntax at a cafe table.
- A transit guard’s routine shifts; they go silent.
- Mara mirrors strangers’ breath pace to practice.
- A wrong interpretation nearly exposes them.
- She writes a rule: interpret twice, act once.

# Chapter
The cafe practiced its noise like a house band. Cups hissed, a grinder coughed, a bell rang flat. Jae placed his hands on the table as if arranging a map no one else could see. Two fingers lay parallel, then one lifted a hair. He didn’t look at her; he looked at the distance between his knuckles.

“Syntax,” he said, and left the word on the wood. A tap near the coaster: set. A breath held half a beat: question. A slide of the index finger to the edge: move.

She tried to mirror without making it performance. Her wrist wanted to dramatize; he shook his head once, and she let the motion shrink until it barely existed. The first time she held the half-beat too long, his eyes cut to the door. A transit guard outside paused mid‑stride, then resumed. The room continued pretending to be a place for coffee.

“Most errors are loud,” Jae said softly. “We don’t add. We remove.” He rotated the coaster a quarter turn and stopped it not with force but with absence — the sort of stop that leaves no sound but registers in skin.

On her way to the archive she practiced the one thing she trusted: breath. She walked alongside strangers and let her lungs fall into step with theirs for two cycles and no more. The city was a chorus; you could sit next to anyone and find a tempo. She wrote the temptation to continue in the air and refused it.

At the platform, an announcement failed in the middle of a warning. People’s heads lifted, then fell. She thought the gap meant a cancelled train and nearly moved. Jae’s hand on her sleeve stopped her without pressure. He shook his head once. The next car slid in with a window of quiet between doors that felt like an invitation. They did nothing.

“Wrong stake,” he murmured. “Don’t answer questions you didn’t ask.”

In the stacks that night, she wrote on a scrap she’d later tape inside a cabinet: interpret twice, act once. The pencil point broke; she smiled, then made the mark duller, slower. She imagined Vessa reading a transcript of their table and getting only toast crumbs and cup rings. It felt safer than the lock on the archive door.
