# Inspiration

The parts we exile don't disappear—they grow teeth in the dark. This is shadow work as compost practice: meeting rage, need, grief, desire without running. Not slaying the monster but sitting with it until you recognize your own eyes staring back. Integration, not elimination. The song builds from whispered fear to embodied presence—not triumph, but wholeness that includes the dark.

# Style Prompt

Spiritual folk-electronic shadow work at 100 BPM. Starts sparse with breath sounds, minimal guitar, and heartbeat percussion. Builds gradually as integration unfolds. Female vocals transition from whisper to full embodied sound—raw edges welcome. Bridge features wordless vocalization (pre-verbal meeting). Hand drums ground the integration; singing bowl signals return to wholeness. No spiritual bypassing, no polished pop, no triumphant resolution.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Breath sounds, minimal guitar, heartbeat percussion]

[Verse 1]
I locked it in the basement years ago
The part of me I didn't want to know
Rage and need and all the hungry dark
I thought if I just smiled, it wouldn't leave a mark

[Chorus]
But the monster inside is just the self I disowned
The grief I wouldn't feel, the truth I wouldn't own
You can't kill what you are, you can only turn away
And what you exile grows teeth, finds another way

[Verse 2]
I hear it scratching at the cellar door
The voice I never let myself speak before
It doesn't want to hurt me, just to be seen
To be welcomed back, composted clean

[Chorus]
'Cause the monster inside is just the self I disowned
The grief I wouldn't feel, the truth I wouldn't own
You can't kill what you are, you can only turn away
And what you exile grows teeth, finds another way

[Bridge]
[Wordless vocalization—hmm, ahh, building]
[Hand drums enter, grounding rhythm]
So I open the door
I sit on the floor
I meet its eyes and see—
It was always me
Just trying to be free

[Chorus]
The monster inside is just the self coming home
The parts I composted back into the whole
You can't kill what you are, only welcome it through
And what you integrate becomes wisdom, becomes true

[Outro]
[Singing bowl enters, sustained tone]
No more exile
No more war
Just presence with what is
And the opening door

# Notes

- Start very sparse and tense—breath, minimal guitar, heartbeat rhythm
- Build gradually as the monster is met and integrated
- Bridge features wordless vocals (pre-verbal meeting)—let it feel visceral, not pretty
- Hand drums enter in bridge to ground the integration
- Singing bowl at outro signals return to resonance/wholeness
- Final line should feel like exhale, not triumph
