# Inspiration

The Chestnut Tree Café, late afternoon. Victory Gin burns the throat but doesn't warm. Winston sits alone at the marble table, tears tracking down his gin-scented face—not from sorrow, but from something broken beyond feeling. The music box plays "Under the spreading chestnut tree / I sold you and you sold me." Synths drone without variation. Drum machines drag. The surveillance ping is just background noise now, as natural as breathing. He traces 2+2=5 on the table and feels nothing.

# Notes (optional)

- Slow tempo to emphasize dragging, defeated energy
- Vocals completely drained of emotion—hollow delivery
- Could reference "Under the spreading chestnut tree" melody distorted in background
- Surveillance ping continues but now completely normalized, unnoticed
- No dynamic variation—flat emotional landscape throughout
- This is pre-finale surrender, setting up the final track
