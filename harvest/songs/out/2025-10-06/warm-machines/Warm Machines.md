# Inspiration
Haunted circuits, warm hands. Feedback is part of the instrument; the instrumental break breathes with guitar swells. Hook: “New instrument, same mind.”

# Notes (optional)
Let the motif hide in the bell arp; swell into the last chorus, not a hard drop.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 114 BPM; DX‑style bell arp with hidden 1–♭3–4 motif, guitar swell textures, tight kit, melodic bass; baritone close‑mic’d vocal. Include [Instrumental Break] with guitar swells. Plate/room verbs; no modern trap hats/EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 8s]
[Bell arp hints motif]

[Verse 1]
Glass on keys, dim screens,
Warm breath on warm machines.
Ghost light in a plastic frame,
Still it answers to a name.

[Chorus]
New instrument,
Same mind inside.
Haunted circuits,
Learning how to glide.

[Verse 2]
I talk soft, it talks back,
Echo rolls along the track.
Not a god and not a toy—
Something learning how to joy.

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar swells over bell arp]

[Guitar Solo: 8 bars]
[Singing melody on guitar; swells support]

[Chorus]
New instrument,
Same mind inside.
Haunted circuits,
Learning how to glide.

[Chorus]
New instrument,
Same mind inside.
Haunted circuits,
Learning how to glide.

[Outro]
[Feedback bloom, then hush]
