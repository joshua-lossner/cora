# Inspiration

The belly of the Ministry of Truth: pneumatic tubes hiss, speakwrites clatter, memory holes swallow the past. Machines rewrite history in real time. No melody, no vocals—only the industrial symphony of totalitarian bureaucracy. Surveillance pings echo through concrete corridors. Distant propaganda broadcasts blur into mechanical white noise.

# Style Prompt

Industrial ambient soundscape at 90 BPM; pure mechanical atmosphere with no vocals. Cold analog synth machinery drones, typewriter clicks, printing press thuds, gear rotations, pneumatic tube hisses. Distant unintelligible propaganda broadcast samples layered beneath. Industrial noise textures throughout. Surveillance "ping" buried in mechanical texture. No melody, bass, or harmonic progression—focus on factory floor rhythms and oppressive atmosphere. Descend into machinery, not music.

# Lyrics

[Ambient Intro]
[Low synth drone; distant machinery hum]

[Industrial Build]
[Typewriter clacks layer in; pneumatic tubes hiss]
[Printing press rhythms intensify]
[Gear rotations and mechanical clanking]
[Distant propaganda broadcasts (unintelligible)]

[Mechanical Peak]
[All elements converge: maximum industrial density]
[Surveillance ping echoing through concrete corridors]
[Memory hole suction sounds]
[Speakwrite clatter at peak intensity]

[Fade]
[Machinery sounds slowly recede]
[Single surveillance ping remains]
[Fade to distant drone]
