# Seed — Coherenceism.studio

A small, coherent music studio for pieces that carry Coherenceism’s tone — reflective, present, and spare. Composed with SUNO (or equivalents), curated as singles and short themed collections.

## Germination Notes
- Surfaces: streaming pages, embedded players on the public site (`coherenceism.info`).
- Cadence: short, repeatable sessions; ship tiny EPs around branches (e.g., Presence, Alignment).
- Voice: minimalism over spectacle; field‑clearing, not crowd‑pleasing.

## MVP Slice
- 3 tracks (Presence, Alignment, Compost) composed with SUNO prompts tied to branch imagery.
- Cover cards derived from leaves/branches; frontmatter credits and dates.
- Publish notes alongside tracks: why this tone, how it serves coherence.

## Rails
- CORA is canonical for descriptions, notes, and track lists.
- Downstream code/site renders players and collections; no canon lives there.

## Guardrails
- Respect licensing; document model/version and prompts used.
- Keep pieces short and intentional; decline tracks that add noise.

## Next Steps (Downstream)
1) Add `coherenceism-studio` to the forest group; create a lightweight site section under `coherenceism.info`.
2) Draft SUNO prompt patterns per branch; compose first 3 tracks.
3) Publish with notes and links back to branch/leaf pages.
