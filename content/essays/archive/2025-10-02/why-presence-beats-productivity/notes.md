# Notes: Presence over Productivity

- Productivity chases volume; presence chases signal.
- Coherence: aligned attention reduces distortion; fewer, clearer moves.
- Examples: meetings → presence (clear goals, constraints); coding → fewer branches, better tests.
- Counterpoint: productivity sprints useful when presence is already set; avoid chronic sprinting.
- Structure idea:
  - Define presence vs productivity
  - Cases: writing, coding, meetings
  - Practical moves: daily resonance check, tight scopes, finish cycles
