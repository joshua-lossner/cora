# Beats
- Vessa seeds decoys; network panics.
- Mara adds breath‑paced double confirmation.
- A decoy pulls Jae into a trap; she holds.
- The archive sounds alarms; they bury under noise.
- She finds a cool seam by touch; real channel.

# Chapter
Noise looks like urgency when it puts on a vest. The city wore five at once. Feeds lit: a broken water main, a pop‑up show, a security advisory about bags, a raffle, a missing cat. Jae’s people started moving because motion feels like safety.

“Hold,” she texted Mira and then deleted it; texts were loud even when muted. In the archive, she wrote two lines on a card and propped it under the desk lip where only someone sitting would see: wait for breath, then confirm.

A decoy pinged the corner where Jae liked to work and she felt the pull. It had all the right ingredients, including the wrong timing. She ran the count and it came up wrong by a hair you’d miss if you weren’t practicing. Jae stepped into the corridor and she did not follow. A man in a reflective watch appeared at the end of the hall as if conjured by good manners.

The building chose then to complain. Alarms in test mode stacked on top of one another and the archive sang a ridiculous choir. She laughed once in it — the absurdity let her cut the fear — and slid along the stacks by palm, letting the varnish tell her where to go.

Her hand found the cool seam where the emergency circuit fed a branch no one visiting would notice. She stood in that seam and felt her breath drop into a pocket. The noise did its performance in another room, for another audience. The seam didn’t care.

When Jae reappeared, later, there was no story in his face about what happened in the corridor, just a small shake and a point at her card under the desk. He tapped twice, waited a breath, tapped again. She nodded. The decoys were still out there, but the seam would outlast them.
