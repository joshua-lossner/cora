# Inspiration

Evening garden scene: soil under fingernails, kitchen scraps turned to dark earth, grief worked like ground. The hook is simple—“Compost the endings”—sung like a blessing. Melodica doubles the refrain, hinting at new shoots.

# Notes (optional)

Keep verses narrative and concrete; chorus mantra‑simple. Use a short slapback on “endings,” longer echo tail on the final chorus tag.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 74 BPM with one‑drop drums (cross‑stick), deep round bass, off‑beat guitar upstrokes, organ bubble, and light congas. Melodica doubles the hook; spring reverb and short tape slap on select words. Keep verses narrative and the chorus mantra‑simple; add a tastefully sparse [Instrumental Break] with dub‑style echoes before the final chorus.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Melodica hints at the chorus line]

[Verse 1]
Kitchen scraps and withered stems,
Turn again to feed the limbs.
Hands in dirt and slow, deep breath—
We make life from little deaths.

[Chorus]
Compost the endings,
Turn them into light.
Compost the endings—
Feed tomorrow right.

[Verse 2]
Put your grief upon the ground,
Let it warm the roots you found.
Time and turning, rain and sun—
See what’s growing when it’s done.

[Chorus]
Compost the endings,
Turn them into light.

[Instrumental Break]
[Drums, bass, and echo‑washed melodica weave]

[Chorus]
Compost the endings,
Turn them into light.

[Outro]
[Melodica/organ tag; fade]
