# Inspiration

A wide‑sky opener: bass like a steady heart, cross‑stick breathing on two and four. Upstroke guitar and organ bubble lift the room while horns state a simple three‑note motif. Lyrics picture a street waking up together—one field, one heartbeat—neighbors syncing to the same gentle pulse.

# Notes (optional)

Keep space around the horns; use tape echo on the last word of each chorus line. The instrumental break should open the panorama, then land back on the heartbeat.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 76 BPM; one‑drop groove with deep round bass, off‑beat guitar upstrokes, organ bubble, light shakers, and tasteful spring reverb/tape echo. Warm soulful lead vocal with gentle lilt; stacked harmonies on choruses. Include a short [Instrumental Break] with dub‑style echoes before the final chorus; keep delays musical, not washed.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Horns state a three‑note motif; organ bubble enters]

[Verse 1]
Morning light on zinc and stone,
Shop doors lift, the street is home.
Footsteps fall in time so sweet,
Hear the city find its beat.

[Chorus]
One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.
One field, one heartbeat—
Lift each other on the street.

[Verse 2]
Old man sweeps the front step clean,
Kids play tag between the green.
Vendors call and neighbors greet,
Every smile keeps time in feet.

[Chorus]
One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.

[Instrumental Break]
[Snare cross‑stick, bass and echo horn tags drift and return]

[Chorus]
One field, one heartbeat,
Many voices, one steady beat.

[Outro]
[Motif tag on horns; melodica echoes the last line]
