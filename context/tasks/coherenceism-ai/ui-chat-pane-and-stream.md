# Task — UI: Chat Pane with Streaming

## Purpose
Implement streaming text rendering with partials, tool-call annotations, and minimal message controls.

## Steps
1) Add incremental rendering for partial tokens.
2) Display tool-call events and results inline.
3) Support copy, pause, and retry.

## Acceptance
- Messages stream smoothly; tool events are visible; basic controls work. ✔

## Roles
- Frontend Engineer — `context/roles/frontend-engineer.md:1`

## Notes
- Design for future audio playback toggles.
