# Fact Check Report

Scope: Annotated draft for claims labeled F/I/U. Verified three F‑claims with resolving sources and a worked numeric example.

Summary
- 3 factual claims (F) present with resolving citations: physical activity guidelines (HHS), sleep deprivation and function (NIH/NHLBI), and minimum payments increasing time/cost (CFPB).
- Money section includes a numeric example consistent with APR math; annotated with citation to CFPB consumer tools page.
- Counterpoint present; describes rest as integration, not avoidance.

Findings by Section
- Define Terms: Coherence definition supported conceptually by [4]. Restorative–avoidance test marked (U).
- Health: (F) 150‑min weekly activity benchmark (HHS); (F) sleep deprivation harms attention/mood/health (NIH). Both cited.
- Money: (F) minimum payments prolong repayment and increase interest; example at 20% APR on $2,000 balance is numerically coherent (approximate interest $33/month at start). Cited to CFPB consumer tools page.
- Relationships: Narrative claims remain (I); no specific study cited—acceptable given scope.
- Practical Moves: Tiny scene included; process recommendations remain (I).

Status
- DEAD_LINKS: none (targets resolve via GET).
- SOURCE_MISMATCH: none observed.
- EVIDENCE_GAP: acceptable residuals in Relationships.
- NO_WORKED_EXAMPLE: PASS.
