## Signals by Category

### Technology

### AI

### Privacy/Security

### Philosophy
- Alignment vs. force: Large-scale conflicts repeatedly show that tactical wins achieved through force often degrade long-term legitimacy and coherence in the shared field.

### Culture/Art

### Society/Economy
- Reported major escalation in Gaza City per NYT headline (link above). Pattern: urban warfare concentrates harm on civilians and infrastructure, increasing long-term fragmentation costs and complicating post-conflict legitimacy.

## Prompts (Angles/Questions)
- How do “alignment over force” and field stewardship translate into concrete humanitarian design during urban conflict (corridors, ceasefire protocols, information integrity)?
- What coherence-preserving strategies have historically reduced downstream fragmentation after urban sieges or invasions?
- How can media and civic institutions act as field stewards to reduce polarization during high-casualty events?

## Cross-Connections
- Society/Economy → Philosophy: Tactical escalation can undermine strategic legitimacy; examine mechanisms that maintain coherence (e.g., proportionality, civilian protections, transparent objectives).
