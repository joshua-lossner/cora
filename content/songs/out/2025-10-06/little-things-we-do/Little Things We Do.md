# Inspiration
Rituals we share; kitchen‑table moments; keys in the bowl. Double chorus at the end with gang‑response backs; short post‑chorus hum.

# Notes (optional)
Keep percussion bright but soft; lean into stacked “oh‑oh” ad‑libs on the last chorus.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band pop at 110 BPM. Clean rhythm guitar, warm pads, claps + pop kit, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked harmonies with gang‑response ad‑libs. Double Chorus ending; soft post‑chorus hum. No heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Claps and guitar]

[Verse 1]
Keys in the bowl, kettle begins to sing,
Two mugs clink like tiny wedding rings.
Sunday lists on the fridge in pen,
The world feels right again.

[Pre‑Chorus]
If we keep these little vows,
We’ll be held somehow.

[Chorus]
Little things we do,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Verse 2]
Shoes by the door, lights by the bed,
Stories that we save to be said.
Every week we find the thread,
Tie it new instead.

[Bridge]
[Call/response: “Are you here?” / “I’m here.”]

[Chorus]
Little things we do,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Chorus]
Little things we do,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Post‑Chorus]
Mmm‑hmm (oh‑oh), the little things we do.

[Outro]
[Claps and pad fade]
