# Inspiration
Shop lights, thread through a needle, hands teaching hands. Verses stitch small daily moves; Chorus names the current that runs through all of it: the living line. Bridge modulates up a step for lift, then back to an easy ride‑out.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Thread by thread, we keep the living line.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul at 88 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums with tambourine; communal baritone lead + light gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus], double [Chorus], and a modest key‑lift [Bridge]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Count‑in; guitar sets the stitch]

[Verse 1]
Thread a needle, hold it true,
Teach the shape from me to you.
Every tug and every bend
Ties the start back to the end.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Take it slow and make it kind,
Feel the pull of living line.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread, we keep the living line,
Hands in rhythm, hearts in time.

[Verse 2]
Pass the pattern down the row,
Let the smallest motions show.
Stitch the daylight into night—
Keep the seam in soft‑good light.

[Bridge]
[Half‑step lift; BGVs bloom]
When it breaks, we tie and mend,
Every ending feeds the thread again.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread, we keep the living line,
Hands in rhythm, hearts in time.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread, we keep the living line,
Hands in rhythm, hearts in time.

[Outro]
[Choir tag; resonance motif]
