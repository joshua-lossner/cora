## Focus Areas

This river tracks:
- **Meaning & identity**: How AI changes what it means to be human
- **Ethics & alignment**: Questions of values, bias, control
- **Relationship patterns**: Collaboration, dependency, co-evolution
- **Existential questions**: Consciousness, agency, shared future

## Inclusion Test
Does this source reveal how humans and AI are becoming together? Is the relationship itself the subject?

## Extraction Guidance
Look for:
- Tension between human autonomy and AI capability
- Questions of meaning, purpose, agency in an AI-mediated world
- Ethical dilemmas and alignment challenges
- Emerging relationship patterns (trust, dependency, collaboration)
- Identity shifts as AI becomes more capable

Coherenceism principles most relevant:
- Technology as Amplifier (tools multiply what exists)
- Mature Uncertainty (confidence in known, humility about unknown)
- Resonance as Truth (which narratives reduce distortion?)
- Living Traditions (old forms adapting to new tools)
