# Inspiration
Alignment over force—“Don’t push, align.” Pre‑chorus tightens; chorus opens wide. Add an 8–16 bar [Dance Break] after Verse 2 before the Bridge for runtime and lift.

# Notes (optional)
Use a call‑and‑response vocal line in the dance break; bring the motif back in the post‑chorus.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band dance‑pop at 122 BPM. Crisp pop drums, polysynth stabs, clean electric guitar, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked harmonies. Pre‑Chorus squeeze → wide Chorus. Add [Dance Break: 16 bars] after Verse 2. No heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Stabs and claps; bass breathes]

[Verse 1]
Head down, pushing like we’re fighting the tide,
White‑knuckle hands and a narrowing stride.
I feel your shoulder brush and something aligns—
We shift, the current carries our lines.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Tip just enough to feel the flow,
Lose the weight you don’t need to hold.

[Chorus]
Lean with me (lean with me),
Don’t push—align.
Let the river in our chest
Find the common line.

[Verse 2]
Streetlights blur into a runway of gold,
We breathe together and the friction lets go.
Nothing louder—just a wider sky,
We open without trying.

[Dance Break]
[16 bars: synth hook answers vocal “oh‑oh”]

[Bridge]
[Drop to claps and bass]
All that force was just a fear of falling—
But we were carried all along.

[Chorus]
Lean with me (lean with me),
Don’t push—align.
Let the river in our chest
Find the common line.

[Post‑Chorus]
Da‑da, da‑da (1–♭3–4),
We lean and we shine.

[Outro]
[Hook repeats; soft ad‑libs]
