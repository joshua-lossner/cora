# Inspiration

Breath and presence in a loud city — sirens, sellers, crosswalk chaos — and you’re still tuned. Hook repeats a quiet power phrase (“be here now” without cliché). Keep the space; let the drums and bass carry.

# Style Prompt

1990s boom‑bap at 90 BPM; mood calm but alert; soft Rhodes pad and sparse jazz loop; punchy kick+snare; filtered bass; roomy, minimal arrangement. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Outro; optional soft female hook. Vocals: reflective, close‑mic cadence; space between lines. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy risers, heavy autotune; keep a dynamic, airy mix.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Low‑pass loop; deep breath in]

[Verse 1]
Crosswalks argue with the horns, sellers cut the price,
Sirens paint the brick with blue; I slow and take advice.
One thing that I see, one I hear, one in my hand,
Presence like a metronome that helps the night to land.
I’m not dodging every ping; I’m choosing what to hear,
Putting all my weight on now, so now can hold me near.
If the habit tries to drag me to a yesterday I miss,
I set the needle back to breath — the record sounds like this:

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Verse 2]
Newsstand headlines thump a drum that isn’t mine to play,
I thank them for the service, then I put the sticks away.
Hands come back to pockets, shoulders settle into ease,
The rhythm’s in the sidewalk cracks and branches of the trees.
I let elevator chatter pass like trains between the stops,
When you stop needing to reply, the stress just curls and drops.
Whatever pulls me out of place can teach me how to stay,
So I bow to what I notice and I start again today.

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Verse 3]
I’m not chasing sacred calm; I’m meeting what it is,
Some days the drum is gentle, some days all it does is fizz.
Either way, I’m coming honest; I let gravity decide,
Lean the bar against the moment till the syllables align.
If each chorus is a practice, then this life’s a looping song,
You can’t force the needle’s journey; you just let it move along.
So the breath and kick agree, and the snare and thought shake hands —
Now I’m here enough to hear enough to do the next small plan.

[Chorus]
Here and now — where the city finds its slow,
Here and now — let the deeper current show.
Here and now — give the noise somewhere to go,
Here and now — breathe steady, keep it low.

[Outro]
[Soft female hum over Rhodes; fade]
