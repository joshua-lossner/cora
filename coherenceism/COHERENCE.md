# Coherenceism — Living Tree

Start at the root: `coherenceism/roots/coherenceism-root.md`.

Structure:
- roots/ — anchors and orientation
- branches/ — major themes
- leaves/ — atomic knowledge units (claims, definitions, patterns, references, questions); building blocks that feed fruit, not publish-ready pieces
- seeds/ — project starters that may spawn downstream trees

Fruit (essays, songs, albums, media) grows from this tree and is gathered under `harvest/` for reuse. Leaves remain in the tree as source knowledge; fruit is the human-facing output stored in the harvest.

For system rails (types, relationships, validation), see `context/documentation/cora/knowledge-tree.md`.
