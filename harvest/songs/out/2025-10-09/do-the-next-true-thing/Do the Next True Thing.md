# Inspiration
Sidewalk morning after rain; light catches in puddles. Verses name small choices—call back, carry a bag, tell the truth kindly. The chorus is plain and singable, a compass you can carry: do the next true thing.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “I ain’t got the whole map, I’ll do the next true thing.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul at 84 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums with tambourine; conversational baritone and light gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus] and a double [Chorus]; pocket steady. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Rain on pavement; guitar rings]

[Verse 1]
Morning after, streets are clean,
Phone is full of in‑betweens.
Pick a call and make it ring,
Tell the truth, the simple thing.

[Pre‑Chorus]
I don’t need a perfect plan,
Just the next thing I can stand.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

[Verse 2]
Lift a box and hold the door,
Write it down and say no more.
Take a breath before I sing—
Choose the small, the steady thing.

[Bridge]
[BGVs nod; organ warms]
Every corner, every mile,
Truth is marked in acts of style.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

[Chorus]
I ain’t got the whole map,
I’ll do the next true thing.

[Outro]
[Tambourine soft; fade]
