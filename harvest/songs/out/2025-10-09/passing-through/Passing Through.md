# Inspiration
Soft porch‑light evening. Names carved in old wood, storms turned to soil, losses folded back into life. Verses tell small endings that feed beginnings; the chorus holds the truth without strain: we’re all just passing through. Bridge shifts to major lift with BGVs, then a quiet Rhodes outro.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul ballad at 76 BPM; fingerpicked clean guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, warm bass, brushed kit with tambourine; intimate baritone lead, light gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus] lift, double [Chorus], and a soft Rhodes [Outro]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Fingerpicked guitar; porch ambience]

[Verse 1]
Storm came down and cleared the air,
Leaves lay quiet on the stair.
Names we carved are fading too—
Wood remembers more than we do.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Every ending makes a room,
Where tomorrow takes its bloom.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Verse 2]
Photo edges curl with time,
Laughter left a steady line.
Hands let go and hands renew—
Love keeps learning how to move.

[Bridge]
[BGVs rise; organ warms]
Lay it down and let it be,
All that’s lost becomes the seed.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gone, we’re only passing through,
Fold it back to feed the living truth.

[Outro]
[Rhodes lullaby; fade]
