# Inspiration

Alignment as pocket: we don’t muscle the groove, we find it. Verse images of gears clicking and dancers syncing, then a chantable chorus that snaps into place on the two and four. A short, smiling guitar solo quotes the three‑note motif.

# Style Prompt

1950s rock & roll at ~158 BPM straight‑eighths with clean twang guitar (slapback), upright bass slap, boogie‑woogie piano, rimshot snare and ride cymbal, and tight doo‑wop backgrounds. Add a brief [Pre‑Chorus] lift before the hook and a compact [Guitar Solo] that quotes a three‑note motif. Mono‑style room image; exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Count‑in; rimshot pickup]

[Verse 1]
Click goes the gear and the hands fall in line,
Step to the left and the right feels fine,
Don’t push the river, let the river find time,
Snap on the two and the pocket feels prime.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Hold that breath, find that sign —
Hear the room lean in, say “align.”

[Chorus]
Shake, rattle, align — hey!
Find the beat and ride the line — hey!
Don’t force the groove, just fall in time,
Shake, rattle, align — hey!

[Verse 2]
Shoes on the floor talk a little duet,
Bass and the kick make a promise they kept,
Guitar says “go” with a grin you won’t forget,
We’re tidy as a clock when the chorus gets set.

[Guitar Solo]
[Short twangy lead quoting the motif]

[Chorus]
Shake, rattle, align — hey!
Find the beat and ride the line — hey!

[Outro]
[Band stab and tape‑slap tail]
