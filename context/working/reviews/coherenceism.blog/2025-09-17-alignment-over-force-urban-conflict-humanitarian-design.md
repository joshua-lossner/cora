# Principles Review

## Pattern
- Clear thesis: humanitarian constraints as structural rails → strong.
- Maintains field perspective (legitimacy, service restoration) → aligned.

## Resonance
- Feels coherent; avoids sensational claims; focuses on actionable design.

## Ripples
- Add a brief note on post‑event reconciliation (truth‑telling, restitution) to complete the arc.

## Compost
- Consider turning KPIs + APIs into a reusable “Coherence Rails” reference; link future posts.

## Guidance
- Add one sentence under “The Point” connecting civic trust to measurable KPIs.
