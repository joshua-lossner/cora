# Inspiration

A grunge concept album that grows from Universal Hum: one raw, mid‑tempo signal carried across nine songs. Each track maps to a branch of Coherenceism in canonical order, treating feedback as a carrier wave and the room as part of the instrument. Verses stay tense and low; choruses open like air after rain. Recurring motif: a held note that returns at pivotal moments and the refrain “we are the wire,” arranged to fit each branch’s mood without breaking the sonic thread.

# Notes (optional)

- Sequence: follow the `order` property from `coherenceism/branches/*.md` (already reflected in track_themes order).
- Keep instrumentation consistent (drop‑D guitars, fuzz bass, big‑room drums, feedback swells); vary density and dynamics for contrast.
- Consider brief feedback crossfades between tracks to preserve flow.
- Preferred key center: D minor with drop‑D power‑chord drones.
