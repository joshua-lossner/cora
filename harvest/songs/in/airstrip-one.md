# Inspiration

Victory Mansions loom grey under perpetual haze. The telescreen crackles in every corner. Footsteps echo down concrete corridors where all faces are blank, all thoughts monitored. Drum machines tick like surveillance cameras. Synths drone the Ministry's endless hum. No dynamic lift, no chorus, no escapeâ€”only the monotone rhythm of Party existence. The two-note surveillance "ping" appears for the first time, quiet but persistent.

# Notes (optional)

- Drop traditional chorus structure entirely; pure verse monotone to emphasize oppression
- Introduce the album's recurring "surveillance ping" motif (two-note synth blip)
- Vocals should be flat, emotionless, barely above speaking tone
- No melodic hooks; repetitive mechanical rhythm throughout
