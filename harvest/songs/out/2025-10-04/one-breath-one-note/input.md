# Inspiration

Breath first, then sound. A restrained verse against a single held note that steadies the hand; the chorus opens but stays grounded. Presence is felt as control — leaving space so the room can sing.

# Notes (optional)

- Drop instruments to bass + drums for a bar before the chorus to “breathe.”
