# Length and Pace — Targets

Book Targets
- If a range is given (e.g., 75–85k), use midpoint for planning; allow ±5% at manuscript level.
- Choose a chapter count early (e.g., 16–24 for most novels) and derive a per‑chapter target.

Chapter Targets
- Aim within ±10–15% of `target_per_chapter`.
- Expand with: micro‑scenes, lived examples, interiority, setting texture, specific beats.
- Trim with: remove redundancy, collapse weak beats, summarize transitions, cut throat‑clearing.

Pacing Tips
- Keep beats concrete (5–9 as a base); add mini‑beats if expansion is needed.
- Alternate intensity (push ↔ breather) at chapter and scene levels.
