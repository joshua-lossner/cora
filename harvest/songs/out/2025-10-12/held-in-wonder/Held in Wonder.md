# Inspiration

Mature uncertainty as a dance: hold the question, not the answer. Moonlight on chrome, late‑night highway, the chorus opens like a sky. The three‑note motif glints in the bridge.

# Style Prompt

Mid‑tempo 1950s swing (~138 BPM) with clean slapback guitar, soft tenor sax, upright bass, and gentle ride cymbal. Gentle lead vocal in English with airy harmonies; include a reflective [Bridge] where the three‑note motif appears before a final chorus. Keep mono‑ish space; exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Soft guitar arpeggio]

[Verse 1]
Headlights threading through an empty town,
Windows down and the noise turned down,
Questions rise like the stars come round,
I let them float, I don’t force them down.

[Chorus]
Held in wonder, night grown wide,
I don’t need answers to enjoy the ride,
Held in wonder, open sky,
I sing the road while the miles slide by.

[Verse 2]
Radio hush and a steady line,
Breath on the glass draws a simple sign,
I let the world hum and I take my time,
Trusting the tune more than any design.

[Bridge]
[Sax echoes the three‑note motif]
If I hold the note and let it ring,
The truth shows up in the song I sing.

[Chorus]
Held in wonder, night grown wide,
I don’t need answers to enjoy the ride.

[Outro]
[Guitar and sax share a soft tag]
