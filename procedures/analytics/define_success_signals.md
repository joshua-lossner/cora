# Procedure — Define Success Signals

Purpose
- Agree on what “good” looks like and how to observe it lightly.

Steps
1) List outcomes; pick 3–5 signals (leading/lagging) per project.
2) Define collection (aggregate, anonymous), cadence, and owners.
3) Sketch a dashboard outline (sections and charts, not tools).

Expected
- Metrics brief and a dashboard outline ready for implementation.
