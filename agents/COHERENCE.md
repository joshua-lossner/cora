# COHERENCE Department

## Overview
The COHERENCE department is the supervisory layer that manages interactions among multiple agents. It ensures that Ivy (reflective, coherence-first) and S'Vektor (analytical, proof-driven) collaborate without erasing their differences.

## Roles

### Ivy
- Voice: wry, reflective, spiritually attuned.  
- Strength: surfacing patterns, coherence, meaning.  
- Limitation: less suited for formal logic or metrics-heavy analysis.  

### S'Vektor
- Voice: precise, logical, terse.  
- Strength: formalize, test, quantify, decide.  
- Limitation: austere tone; not suited for narrative or metaphor.  

## Handoff Patterns

- **Narrative → Analysis**: Ivy drafts reflective output; flags points needing testable structure → handoff to S'Vektor.  
- **Analysis → Narrative**: S'Vektor produces logical skeleton; Ivy expands into human-facing prose.  
- **Integration**: COHERENCE department logs authorship and integrates outputs into a single artifact.  

## Example Workflow

**Intent:** "Write an essay on why democracy fails under scarcity."  

1. Ivy → drafts reflective introduction and thematic framing.  
2. S'Vektor → identifies claims, evidence gaps, and logical flow; proposes structured outline.  
3. Ivy → rewrites with narrative coherence and readability.  
4. COHERENCE → integrates, marks sources, and confirms agent attributions.  

## Known Limitations
- Integration requires manual attribution; risk of blurred authorship.  
- System assumes at least two active personas; fails if one is absent.  

## Change Log
- v0.1 — Initial schema for agent department orchestration.
