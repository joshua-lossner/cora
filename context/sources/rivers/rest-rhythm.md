## Focus Areas

This river tracks:
- **Embodied practice**: Presence, attention, daily rhythms
- **Cycles & seasons**: Natural patterns, compost, renewal
- **Resourcing coherence**: How we sustain ourselves
- **Burnout & recovery**: Cultural exhaustion patterns

## Inclusion Test
Does this change how I pace or resource today?

## Extraction Guidance
Look for:
- Cultural exhaustion patterns (burnout, overwhelm)
- Shifts in how people are resourcing themselves
- Attention economy struggles
- Seasonal/cyclical thinking
- Embodied practices gaining traction
- Stories of recovery, rest, rhythm

Coherenceism principles most relevant:
- Presence as Foundation (attention reveals patterns)
- Compost Cycles (transform endings into nutrients)
- Alignment over Force (position, don't push)
- Field Stewardship (actions clarify or distort)
