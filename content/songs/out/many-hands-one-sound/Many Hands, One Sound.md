# Lyrics
[Title: "Many Hands, One Sound"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~100 BPM]
[Chord Progression: verse call/response; chorus wider]

[Intro]
[Count‑in; stick clicks; room chatter faint.]

[Verse 1]
You sing a line — I take the thread,
We stitch a sound from what we’ve said,
Hands on hands, the old song grows,
The room remembers how it goes.

[Chorus]
Many hands, one sound, we rise,
Every voice a rough surprise,
Many hands, one sound, we come,
All our noise made into one.

[Verse 2]
Floorboards beat a second drum,
Footsteps add to what’s begun,
Every echo joins the frame,
We carry and we keep the flame.

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar riff rides; floor toms pound; room shouts answer the hits.]

[Chorus]
Many hands, one sound, we rise,
Every voice a rough surprise,
Many hands, one sound, we come,
All our noise made into one.

[Outro]
[Shouts fade; guitars ring.]
