kind: procedure
id: refine_style
version: 0.4
purpose: "Tighten prose for clarity, rhythm, and coherence while preserving the author's voice and labeled claims."
inputs:
  required:
    - draft.md
  optional:
    - tone            # e.g., 'reflective, unsentimental'
    - audience
    - style.pack      # optional style hints (lexicon, cadence, taboo list)
outputs:
  - refined.md
  - edits.diff.md
agents:
  actor: ivy
constraints:
  - "Do not remove claim labels (F/I/U)."
  - "Preserve author’s voice where specified; avoid generic polish."
  - "Prefer short sentences and concrete nouns; avoid hedging."
  - "Vary sentence length; include at least one longer reflective line per major section."
  - "Include a concrete opening hook (image or micro-scene) within the first 2 sentences."
  - "Deepen Counterpoint: describe how restorative rest integrates change; avoid puritan/hustle tones."
  - "In 'Practical Moves', include a tiny lived scene (e.g., Sunday night audit) to ground the checklist."
  - "Weave citations naturally: prefer footnotes in the final; allow at most one conversational in-text nod (e.g., 'research shows…'); avoid pamphlet tone."
eval_checks:
  - "Readability target roughly Grade 8–10 unless specified otherwise."
  - "No redundant paragraphs or repeated claims."
  - "Headings form a visible argument spine."
  - "Opening hook present and concrete within first 2 sentences."
  - "Counterpoint mentions rest as integration, not avoidance."
  - "Practical Moves includes a tiny scene (2–4 sentences) to humanize the checklist."
  - "Ending points forward (not mere restatement), offering a small, daily choice."
  - "Cadence varies: avoid uniformly short sentences across a section."
  - "Citations balanced: footnotes-first; in-text attributions <= 1; voice carries weight."
  - "Relationships section contains a vivid image or micro-scene (the knot or a boundary voiced)."
failure_modes:
  - code: VOICE_LOSS
    remedy: "Re-run with explicit 'style.pack' and compare against original; restore idioms."
  - code: RAMBLE
    remedy: "Cut or compress; move tangents to 'Appendix / Next'."
  - code: LABEL_DROP
    remedy: "Restore F/I/U markers; reject if restoration impossible."

  edit_note: |
    <!-- edit: {{reason}} | before: "{{before}}" | after: "{{after}}" -->
  hook_template: |
    <!-- hook: concrete image -->
    The second cookie, the midnight scroll, the tab left open like a wound under gauze.
  ending_template: |
    <!-- ending: forward-looking line -->
    Comfort numbs the wound; coherence lets you stand without limping. The choice comes small and daily.
  scene_prompt: |
    <!-- scene: tiny lived moment in Practical Moves -->
    Sunday night. Calendar open, lights low. Five comfort loops on paper; one swap circled for the week ahead.
  relationships_scene_prompt: |
    <!-- relationships: tiny scene or sharper image -->
    The knot you carry after ducking the talk; the breath you get back the moment a boundary is voiced.
  citation_weave_template: |
    <!-- weave: conversational rhythm for a metric -->
    Roughly 150 minutes a week. That’s the bar. Hit it, and life feels lighter.

# Notes (human/agent)

- Cut confidently; add sparingly. Clarity beats ornament.
- Preserve claim labels; they anchor later checks.
- If tone conflicts with audience, ask for guidance rather than guessing.
