# Inspiration
A library that listens back. Pauses as addresses; warmth of tape and wood; night HVAC hush.

# Style Prompt
Downtempo/ambient at ~82–86 BPM with tape‑warm piano, analog pads, soft brush kit, and low room noise; intimate female lead, breathy harmonies. Motifs: HVAC hush, reel‑to‑reel click, wood creaks; pauses used as musical space. [Intro: room tone + tape start] [Bridge: held rest as address] Negatives: no epic drums, no washed‑out reverb, no metallic distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Tape clicks on; room breathes]

[Verse 1]
Shelves settle like a creature in sleep
Labels whisper what the hands can’t keep
Boxes marked misc but corners align
Weight in the arm tells a hidden design

[Chorus]
Archive of breath, speak when you’re still
Address in a pause, answer by will
Hold out the space, let meaning collect
Quiet returns what noise can’t detect

[Verse 2]
Reel in a tin with PAUSES in ink
Play, and the silence says more than we think
Numbers and names in a staggered array
Time is a hallway that points the way

[Bridge]
[HVAC hush; footfall on wood]
Touch the knob and don’t turn it — good

[Chorus]
Archive of breath, speak when you’re still
Address in a pause, answer by will
Hold out the space, let meaning collect
Quiet returns what noise can’t detect

[Outro]
[Tape whirr winds down]
