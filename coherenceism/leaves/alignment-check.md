# Micro-Practice — The Alignment Check

Before a meeting, conversation, or decision — pause and ask:

- Do my thoughts fit the reality of this moment, or just my habits?
- Do my actions serve the situation’s needs, or just my preferences?
- Is my presence helping this moment feel more open, or more closed?

Don’t overthink the answers — you’ll feel them.
