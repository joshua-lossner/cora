# Notes: Coherence vs Comfort

- People chase comfort to avoid short-term pain; problems compound.
- Coherence = alignment of belief, word, and action; reduces friction over time.
- Examples: diet, sleep, debt payoff; short discomfort for durable freedom.
- Counterpoint: comfort is necessary for recovery; how to distinguish restorative comfort from avoidance.
- Possible structure:
  - Define terms (comfort, coherence)
  - Three cases (health, money, relationships)
  - Practical moves (audit, replace, maintain)
