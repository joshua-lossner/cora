Title
- Add “Branches of Coherence” smooth‑jazz album and 9 Suno‑ready songs

Summary
- Create a late‑night smooth jazz concept album inspired by Coherenceism branches. Adds album overview and links index, and compiles 9 track outputs (style prompts + instrumental cues). Keeps feel warm, reflective, and unhurried with a recurring three‑note resonance motif. No separate archives; rely on git history.

What Changed

  - (No album archive folder; provenance via git history)

Checks Run
- Manual content hygiene pass: frontmatter present; links resolve from album index; consistent instrumentation/mood/BPM across tracks.
- No external network calls; content‑only changes.
- Follow‑up: optional run of procedures/content/validate-content.md:1 in a later pass.

Impact
- Adds a complete Suno‑ready album with coherent track set; no breaking changes; downstream sites can render album/track pages from UFC content.
