# Inspiration
Museum hush, stargazing fields, the unnameable in ordinary rooms. Verses move with slow attention; Chorus holds a single phrase like a held breath—deep quiet wonder. Bridge opens harmony, then returns to the smallest sound: a fingertip on strings and a whispered BGV hum.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Deep quiet wonder.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul ballad at 76 BPM; fingerpicked clean guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, brushed kit, warm bass; tender baritone lead with hushed BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus], double [Chorus], very soft [Outro]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Guitar harmonics; room tone]

[Verse 1]
Empty hall with polished floor,
Footsteps turn to something more.
Breath comes back a second time—
Every echo draws a line.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Name it once and let it be,
It grows when given room to breathe.

[Chorus]
Deep quiet wonder,
Hold me under.

[Verse 2]
Fields of stars in folded sky,
Coffee steam and lonesome sigh.
Ordinary turns to gold—
Silence sings a note I hold.

[Bridge]
[BGVs bloom; organ swells]
If I chase it, it will fade,
If I listen, it will stay.

[Chorus]
Deep quiet wonder,
Hold me under.

[Chorus]
Deep quiet wonder,
Hold me under.

[Outro]
[Hushed BGVs; single guitar note]
