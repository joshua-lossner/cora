# Assumptions and Risks

Top risks to argument integrity:

1) Evidence Gaps (THIN_EVIDENCE)
- Several claims rest on general knowledge without cited sources.
- Mitigation: treat as (I) for now; propose 3 discriminating sources per domain.

2) Category Error (COMFORT vs REST)
- Restorative comfort (healing) can be misread as avoidance.
- Mitigation: add a simple test: does this reduce friction tomorrow without hidden debt? If yes, restorative.

3) Context Sensitivity (OVERFIT)
- Health, money, and relationship dynamics vary across individuals.
- Mitigation: state scope and note exceptions; recommend smallest viable swaps.
