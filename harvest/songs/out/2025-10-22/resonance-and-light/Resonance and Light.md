# Inspiration

After shadow, death, and uncertainty—what remains? Not arrival, not "healed," but aligned. Coherence as ongoing capacity, not destination. The singing bowl still ringing. This closing track is brief, luminous, open-ended. Not triumph. Not closure. Just the practice continuing, the resonance holding, the light that comes from alignment with what is.

# Style Prompt

Intimate spiritual folk at 88 BPM. Fingerpicked acoustic guitar, prominent 432 Hz singing bowls, sparse reflective piano. Clear female voice, conversational and warm—no performance, just presence. Double chorus structure to let the central idea land. Includes one audible breath before final lines. Outro: singing bowl sustains 10 seconds into silence. No forced uplift, no polished pop, no spiritual bypassing.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Singing bowl enters, sustained]
[Acoustic guitar fingerpicking begins]

[Verse 1]
I thought I'd arrive at some final shore
Where the work was done and I'd hurt no more
But the bowl keeps ringing, the light keeps moving
Coherence isn't landing—it's choosing and choosing

[Chorus]
This is resonance, not resolution
This is practice, not conclusion
The light doesn't mean you're saved
It means you stayed—
Present in the wave

[Verse 2]
[Piano enters, sparse]
I met the shadow, I sat with the bones
I watched the scary movie, I composted what I'd known
Not to transcend it, not to rise above
Just to be with what is—that's the deepest love

[Chorus]
This is resonance, not resolution
This is practice, not conclusion
The light doesn't mean you're saved
It means you stayed—
Present in the wave

[Chorus]
[Double—let it land]
This is resonance, not resolution
This is alignment, not absolution
The bowl keeps ringing through the dark
And you keep listening—
That's the art

[Outro]
[Singing bowl prominent, guitar fades]
[One audible breath]
Still here
Still listening
Still aligned

[Singing bowl sustains and fades to silence—10 seconds]

# Notes

- Double chorus at end (structure allows this)—let the central idea really land
- Singing bowl is the sonic and symbolic anchor—literal and metaphorical resonance
- Keep production intimate—this is a quiet closing, not a finale
- Include one audible breath before final spoken/sung lines (presence as breath)
- Outro singing bowl should ring for 10 full seconds into silence—let the resonance carry
- No big resolution—just the ongoing practice, the continued presence
- The "light" is alignment, not escape or transcendence
