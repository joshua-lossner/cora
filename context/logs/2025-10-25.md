### 2025-10-25T00:15:00+0000 — workflow — rest-rhythm field observation and blog post

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/2025-10/rest-rhythm-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/2025-10/rest-rhythm-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-25-the-five-minute-reset-beats-the-twelve-hour-push.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-rest-rhythm.md
- Summary: Ran rest-rhythm workflow offline using internal leaves and a cultural signal; extracted three seeds and published one post on micro-resets as daily pacing.
- Outcome: One published post; all five rivers now validated across workflow.
- Follow-ups: Re-run scans with live feeds when network access is available; consider a short “input hygiene” post from Seed 3.

### 2025-10-25T00:00:00+0000 — workflow — history-systems field observation and blog post

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/2025-10/history-systems-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/2025-10/history-systems-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-25-when-counting-replaces-witnessing-legitimacy-thins-out.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-history-systems.md
- Summary: Ran history-systems workflow offline using recent in-repo sources; created scan and extraction, drafted and published one post applying Field Stewardship and Nested Coherence to measurement vs. presence.
- Outcome: One published post; history-systems river validated. Rest-rhythm remains to test next.
- Follow-ups: Run rest-rhythm workflow; revisit richer evidence when network access is available.
