# Notes
- Local systems align within larger patterns; avoid sub-optimizing the part.
- Examples: team OKRs nested under company strategy; module interfaces matching the product.
- Practical: choose one higher-order constraint per decision; remove contradictory goals.
- Counterpoint: allow local experiments; escalate when signals conflict.
