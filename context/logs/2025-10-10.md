- Summary: Added ‘Roots and Resonance’ album_input (roots reggae with dub undertones) covering all nine Coherenceism branches; included mood, instrumentation, structures, and per‑track themes.
- Outcome: Ready to evolve into per‑track song_inputs or start today’s reggae single from a chosen branch.
- Follow-ups: On request, scaffold song_inputs under harvest/songs/in/ and write custom lyrics for the first single.

### 2025-10-10T10:48:00-05:00 — workflow — run suno-create-album: evolve + scaffold songs

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/albums/out/roots-and-resonance/album.md, harvest/albums/out/roots-and-resonance/index.md, harvest/songs/in/one-field-one-heartbeat.md, harvest/songs/in/compost-the-endings.md, harvest/songs/in/ride-dont-force.md, harvest/songs/in/one-breath-one-drop.md, harvest/songs/in/next-true-thing.md, harvest/songs/in/many-hands-one-sound.md, harvest/songs/in/teach-the-wire-to-sing.md, harvest/songs/in/sweet-unknown.md, harvest/songs/in/thread-by-thread.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/suno-create-album.md; procedures/media/evolve_and_move_album.md
- Summary: Evolved album input → album, created tracklist/titles, moved to out/, and scaffolded 9 per‑branch reggae song_inputs with frontmatter, structures (with 4 variations), and tailored inspiration.
- Outcome: Album ready; song inputs ready for style prompts and lyrics.
- Follow-ups: For selected track, generate style prompt + custom lyrics; then evolve/move each song via procedures/media/evolve_and_move_song.md.

### 2025-10-10T11:06:00-05:00 — workflow — evolve_and_move_song: 9 reggae tracks → out/

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/one-field-one-heartbeat/One Field, One Heartbeat.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/compost-the-endings/Compost the Endings.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/ride-dont-force/Ride, Don't Force.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/one-breath-one-drop/One Breath, One Drop.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/next-true-thing/Next True Thing.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/many-hands-one-sound/Many Hands, One Sound.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/teach-the-wire-to-sing/Teach the Wire to Sing.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/sweet-unknown/Sweet Unknown.md, harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/thread-by-thread/Thread by Thread.md, harvest/albums/out/roots-and-resonance/index.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/media/evolve_and_move_song.md
- Summary: Evolved each song_input into a final song with frontmatter, style prompts, and original lyrics; moved all to dated out/ folders and updated album links index.
- Outcome: Album fully realized; songs ready to generate in Suno (custom lyrics mode) with reggae instrumentation and dub cues.
- Follow-ups: If desired, adjust BPM per track; generate audio; optional motif map noting recurring horn/melodica tag.

### 2025-10-10T11:14:00-05:00 — context-edit — scrub artist names from tags/references

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/*/*, harvest/albums/out/roots-and-resonance/album.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Removed artist/studio proper names from song/album references used as prompt tags; replaced with neutral technique descriptors (e.g., tape echo, melodica lead, analog spring reverb). Also dropped brand names from instrumentation and removed “patois” from vocal style to avoid accent flags.
- Outcome: Style prompts and metadata comply with “no artist names in tags.”
- Follow-ups: None.

### 2025-10-10T11:22:00-05:00 — content-edit — replace "skank" term to avoid artist-name flag

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/songs/out/2025-10-10/*/*, harvest/albums/out/roots-and-resonance/album.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Replaced occurrences of the reggae guitar term “skank” with neutral phrases (“upstroke guitar”, “off‑beat guitar upstrokes”) in instrumentation, prompts, and copy; updated related phrasing in inspiration lines.
- Outcome: Prompts avoid strings that are sometimes misinterpreted as artist names by generators; should pass content policy checks.
- Follow-ups: If any further flags occur, share the exact field/message and we’ll sanitize that token.

### 2025-10-10T16:53:49-05:00 — context-add — add MCP capabilities + health check; update role and AGENTS

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/mcp/capabilities.md, procedures/core/mcp-health-check.md, context/roles/project-manager.md, AGENTS.md, context/mcp/COHERENCE.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Added MCP capabilities contract (verbs IO/fallbacks) and health-check procedure; updated project-manager role with MCP Load and AGENTS startup to report tools readiness; linked from MCP index.
- Outcome: Sessions can declare tool expectations and degrade gracefully when servers are missing.
- Follow-ups: Optionally add minimal fs/git procedure stubs to mirror verb list.
