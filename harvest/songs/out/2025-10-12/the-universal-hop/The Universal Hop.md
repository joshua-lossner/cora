# Inspiration

The room already hums — we’re stepping into a beat that’s there before we play. Taut upright bass, twang guitar with a wink of tape echo, and a three‑note “resonance” lick that tags the intro. The chorus invites the whole crowd: one field, one pocket, one hop.

# Style Prompt

Fast 1950s rock & roll shuffle (~156 BPM) with clean twang guitar and tape‑slapback, upright bass slap, boogie‑woogie piano, handclaps, and doo‑wop backing vocals. Energetic lead vocal in English; include a [Guitar Solo] and a [Handclap Break], then a double [Chorus] ending. Center‑heavy mono image; no modern trap/EDM, autotune, or contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Band hits; three‑note “resonance” lick]

[Verse 1]
Streetlight sparkle on the chrome and the clock,
Heart finds the pocket when the kicks hit the rock,
Feet start talkin’ in a language we got,
Everybody hear it when the room says “hop.”

[Chorus]
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
We fall in time and the noise drops out,
One field, one pocket, one hop — shout!

[Verse 2]
Bass slaps steady like a train on the rail,
Guitar says “yeah” with a shiver and a tail,
Piano grins wide with a left‑hand tale,
Sax leans in when the dancers sail.

[Guitar Solo]
[Twang lead quotes the three‑note motif]

[Handclap Break]
[Claps on two and four; crowd call‑and‑response “hop!”]

[Chorus]
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!

[Chorus]
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!
One field, one pocket, one hop — hey!

[Outro]
[Band tag on the three‑note lick; short fade]
