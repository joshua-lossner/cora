# Workflows

## Purpose
Define end-to-end workflows that chain agents, commands, and methodologies to produce consistent outcomes.

## Structure
- Organize by project: `workflows/<project-name>/*.md`.
- Root contains `COHERENCE.md` and `_templates/` only.
- Template: `workflows/_templates/workflow.md`.
- Keep workflows concise; link to agents, commands, and methods.

## Available Workflows (by project)
- coherenceism.blog/blog-post.md — Research → Outline → Draft → Review → Edit → Publish

## Notes
- Use clear Actors, Inputs, Outputs, Steps, and Success Signals.
- Prefer commands in `commands/core|git|project|writing` and methods in `context/methodologies/`.
