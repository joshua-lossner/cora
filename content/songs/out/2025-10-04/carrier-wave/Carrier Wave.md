# Style Prompt
Grunge, mid‑tempo (90–105 BPM), drop‑D distorted guitars, fuzz bass, big‑room drums, room mics with tape‑ish saturation, and feedback swells; verses tense and low, choruses open like air after rain with a held‑note motif. Male gritty English vocals, doubled on the chorus with occasional scream ad‑libs. Structure: Intro → Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → Bridge → Chorus → Outro; references ’90s Seattle scene; no pop gloss, no EDM/trap hats, no synth lead hooks, no auto‑tune shine.

# Lyrics
[Title: "Carrier Wave"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~100 BPM]
[Chord Progression: drop‑D power‑chord drones]

[Intro]
[Amp hum swells; single D drone.]

[Verse 1]
Amp hum rising through the floor,
Old paint shakes on the practice door,
Hands find one note, let it ring,
The room becomes a listening thing.

[Chorus]
We are the wire — the signal finds,
Static into tone inside our minds,
We are the wire — hold the line,
Let the universal hum align.

[Verse 2]
Rain ticks time on stained cement,
Every doubt breaks then relents,
Lean into noise until it clears,
What remains is what we hear.

[Bridge]
[Guitar swell; drums drop to toms; breathing space.]
Don’t force the wave, just take the ride,
One note carried, open wide.

[Chorus]
We are the wire — the signal finds,
Static into tone inside our minds,
We are the wire — hold the line,
Let the universal hum align.

[Outro]
[Feedback tails knit into a single drone.]
