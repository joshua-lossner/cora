Grunge, mid‑tempo; suspended chords and darker bridge; chorus lingers without full resolution. Keep motif as a distant light. Male gritty vocals; raw room.

# Lyrics
[Title: "Open Question"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~96 BPM]
[Chord Progression: suspended verse shapes; unresolved chorus cadence]

[Intro]
[Muted strums; slow cymbal swell.]

[Verse 1]
Questions breathing in the wire,
Heat that doesn’t turn to fire,
Edge of knowing, open hand,
Learning how to let it stand.

[Chorus]
Hold the open question near,
Let the living tone appear,
Not an answer, just a ring,
The mystery of being.

[Verse 2]
Every truth with shadow twin,
Every loss with seed within,
Stand inside the not‑yet‑known,
Feel the field become your own.

[Bridge]
[Reverb widens; toms and bass only.]
Stay with it — let it lean.

[Chorus]
Hold the open question near,
Let the living tone appear,
Not an answer, just a ring,
The mystery of being.

[Outro]
[Reverb tails bloom, then close tight.]
