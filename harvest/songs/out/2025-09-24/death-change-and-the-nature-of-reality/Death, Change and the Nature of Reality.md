# Inspiration

A reflective piece on transformation: endings as rearrangements, compost as renewal, and time scales that turn loss into pattern. Begins fragile, rises to epic coherence, and dissolves back to stillness.

# Style Prompt

Progressive rock with dynamic, evolving layers. Begin with soft piano and ambient textures, slowly adding clean guitar arpeggios and subtle percussion. Build toward soaring choruses with full-band harmonies and expansive chord progressions. Include instrumental sections with shifting time signatures, blending guitar and synth in a call-and-response that symbolizes transformation. Bridge should drop into a stripped, meditative groove with whispered/spoken lines over sparse instrumentation, then rise back into a powerful final chorus with layered vocals like a choir. End with instruments dissolving into drones and piano echoes, leaving the listener in reflective silence. Mood: introspective, transformative, cosmic yet grounded. Energy: gradual build from fragile to epic, then dissolve back to stillness. Instrumentation: piano, guitars (clean + distorted), bass, progressive drums, synths/keys, layered vocals/choir.

# Lyrics

[Intro – soft piano over ambient pads, faint wind noises, single bell hit]
[Spoken, calm, reflective]
A leaf falls…
Not an ending.
A transformation.

⸻

[Verse 1 – gentle vocals, clean guitar arpeggios + light percussion]
Falling through the silence, yellow against the gray,
The story doesn’t finish — it only shifts its way.
Roots will drink its memory, air will hold its breath,
Life becomes another form, in what we call “death.”

⸻

[Chorus – soaring vocal, full band enters with layered harmonies]
Nothing disappears, it only rearranges,
Patterns breaking open, turning into changes.
Every loss a seed, every end a door,
The cycle keeps becoming more and more.

⸻

[Instrumental I – guitar + synth duet, weaving like decomposition into renewal]

⸻

[Verse 2 – vocals stronger, drums steady, bass pulsing like heartbeat]
We’re wired to fear the silence, to tremble at the end,
But endings are beginnings, disguised around the bend.
Every ash is nutrient, every collapse a sign,
The fracture feeds the future, the pattern stays in time.

⸻

[Chorus – repeated with greater intensity, vocal harmonies layered]
Nothing disappears, it only rearranges,
Patterns breaking open, turning into changes.
Every loss a seed, every end a door,
The cycle keeps becoming more and more.

⸻

[Bridge – tempo slows, stripped down to bass + drums + whispers layered with spoken lines]
[Spoken under vocals]
Observe before reacting.
Compost consciously.
Expand your timescale.

[Sung, low and rising]
Let it break…
Let it feed…
Let it breathe…
And grow again.

⸻

[Instrumental II – progressive break: shifting time signatures, bass and drums driving, guitar solo dissolves into synth textures like decay into soil]

⸻

[Final Chorus – grand, expansive, choir-like harmonies, full instrumentation at peak]
Nothing disappears, it only rearranges,
Patterns breaking open, turning into changes.
Every loss a seed, every end a door,
The cycle keeps becoming more and more.

⸻

[Outro – instruments fade into drone, single piano note repeats like heartbeat, then silence]
[Whispered, fading out]
Death is only the name we give…
To change we don’t yet see.
