# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Soft instrumental intro; resonance motif hinted on Rhodes]

[Head A]
[Tenor sax states the motif; let phrases breathe]

[Head B]
[Clean guitar echoes the theme; Rhodes keeps space]

[Solo 1]
[Tenor sax solo — lyrical, short]

[Solo 2]
[Guitar solo — melodic, restrained]

[Head A]
[Return to motif, softer]

[Outro]
[Fade on motif; brushes and bass hold]
