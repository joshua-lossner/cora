# Inspiration

A forbidden thought flickers in the grey. Winston's pen hesitates over the diary's blank page—"Down with Big Brother"—the words themselves a death sentence. The mechanical rhythm gains urgency, drum machines stutter and glitch. Synths rise with paranoid tension. The surveillance ping grows more insistent. Vocals shift from monotone to whispered intensity as consciousness awakens to its own imprisonment.

# Notes (optional)

- Build tension through the track; mechanical rhythms should occasionally stutter/glitch
- Surveillance ping motif appears more frequently, creating paranoia
- Chorus should feel dangerous, like speaking forbidden words
- Bridge could feature distorted "Big Brother" backing vocals (ominous)
