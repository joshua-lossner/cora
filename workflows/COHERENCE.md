# Workflows

## Purpose
Define end-to-end workflows that chain agents, procedures, and methodologies to produce consistent outcomes.

## Structure
- Organize by tree: `workflows/<tree-name>/*.md`.
- Root contains `COHERENCE.md` and `_templates/` only.
- Template: `workflows/_templates/workflow.md`.
- Keep workflows concise; link to personas, procedures, and methods.

## Available Workflows
Downstream consumers define their own workflows in their repos. CORA (trunk) does not track site- or tree-specific workflows.

## Notes
- Use clear Actors, Inputs, Outputs, Steps, and Success Signals.
- Prefer procedures in `procedures/core|git|forest|writing` and methods in `context/methodologies/`.
