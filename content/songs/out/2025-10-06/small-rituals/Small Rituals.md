# Inspiration
We keep a city alive by what we repeat. Handclaps and gang‑response backing make the lift communal; the double chorus seals it.

# Notes (optional)
Keep verses intimate; widen the stereo field on the first chorus.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 110 BPM; clean rhythm guitar, warm pad, 606 claps layered with live kit, melodic bass; baritone close‑mic’d vocal with gang‑response backing on choruses. Double [Chorus] ending. Plate/room verbs; no modern trap hats/EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 6s]
[Handclaps with muted guitar]

[Verse 1]
Keys in the bowl, kettle on,
Someone hums the same old song.
Little things that keep us near—
We arrive when they appear.

[Chorus]
Small rituals,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Verse 2]
Wednesday night, folding clothes,
Passing stories soft and low.
Every week we find the thread—
Tie it new, not like it’s dead.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Claps and bass carry; guitar adds jangle]

[Bridge]
[Call and response: “Are you here?” / “I’m here.”]

[Chorus]
Small rituals,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Chorus]
Small rituals,
Hold us in time.
Hands on the table,
Hearts fall in line.

[Outro]
[Claps and pad fade]
