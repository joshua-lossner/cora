# Inspiration
Tuning a room to subtract. We change us: small internal shifts open a window.

# Style Prompt
Cinematic downtempo ~86 BPM; subtractive mix with analog pads, soft drums, muted bass, minimal piano figures; hushed female lead, whisper harmonies. Theme: tuning self to open a window; small shifts; a single‑vibe room. [Intro: door close + hush] [Break: metronome‑like clicks, then cleaner window] Negatives: no big risers, no bombastic cymbals, no heavy sidechain pump.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Door closes; rug absorbs]

[Verse 1]
Walls dressed in velvet and air
Count with a pulse we can share
Raise up a hand, tap the time
Let every movement be small and kind

[Chorus]
We change us, the window clears
Breath aligns the room of years
In the still, the signal blooms
Carry it out of listening rooms

[Verse 2]
Lights test the line with a blink
Panic arrives, asks us to think
Do nothing now — let it pass
What we don’t add is part of the craft

[Bridge]
[Click... click... slower bar]
Open, not wide — just where we are

[Chorus]
We change us, the window clears
Breath aligns the room of years
In the still, the signal blooms
Carry it out of listening rooms

[Outro]
[One phone vibrates once]
