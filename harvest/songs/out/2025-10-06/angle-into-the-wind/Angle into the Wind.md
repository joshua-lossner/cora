# Inspiration
Alignment over force: lean into the current, don’t fight it. Pre‑chorus tightens the spring; chorus opens like air after rain. Hook: “Don’t push—align.”

# Notes (optional)
Keep the snare restrained; let the bass carry the lift into the chorus.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 122 BPM, motorik 707 hi‑hats with tight live snare, jangle rhythm guitars, Juno pad, melodic bass; baritone close‑mic’d vocal. Include [Pre‑Chorus] lift before a wide but not louder [Chorus]. Plate/room verbs; no modern trap hats or EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Jangle guitar; bass outlines Dm]

[Verse 1]
Crosswind on the overpass,
Paper birds in broken glass.
Every urge to brace and push—
Teaches you the harder crush.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Lean a little, feel the line,
Catch the current, read the sign.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—align.
Angle into the wind,
And you’ll find
It carries you in.

[Verse 2]
Traffic hum in minor keys,
A billboard flickers “Please.”
Shift your weight, release the jaw—
Suddenly the drag is gone.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Motorik hats; bass run; guitar holds a drone]

[Bridge]
[Hi‑hats close; pad blooms]
Hold the thread and take your time,
Everything will realign.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—align.
Angle into the wind,
And you’ll find
It carries you in.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—align.
Angle into the wind,
And you’ll find
It carries you in.

[Outro]
[Bass motif; guitars shimmer]
