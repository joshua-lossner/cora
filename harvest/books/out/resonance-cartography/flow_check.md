# Flow Check — Resonance Cartography

## Voice Continuity
- POV/Tense: 2nd person, present — maintain medium‑close distance, plain diction, gently lyrical when image clarifies method.

## Threads Register (enter/carry/resolve)
- Listening Field (breath → anchor → brief → map): Ch1 enter; Ch2 carry (ritualize); later chapters echo.
- Clarity × Pull Canvas: Ch1 enter; Ch2 carry (use to name distortions); Ch3 carry (signals vs noise).
- Signals vs Noise: Ch1 seed; Ch2 carry (distortion sources); Ch3 resolve/expand.
- Small Moves + Owners/Clocks + Stop Criteria: Ch1 enter; recur each chapter; resolve in Stewardship.

## Open Loop Ledger
- Ch1 exit: Test “Next Step Hint” (10% traffic) + explain‑why tag suggestion; stop if misroutes ↓ <20%.
  - Next address: Ch2 — keep distortion visible while testing; name rituals.

## Cadence & Length
- Targets: 4,875 ±15% per chapter; allow up to 3 chapters at ±20% if total stays within ±5%.
- Banding: Alternate higher‑intensity (Field/Practice) with lower‑intensity (Method/Stewardship) chapters.

## Linkers (Chapter 1 → Chapter 2 options)
1) “You shipped a sliver on Friday. On Monday, the hum returns—delay, status, theater—so you name it before it names you.”
2) “The room kept its pitch for a week. Now you tune the part that always drifts: the distortions no one means but everyone makes.”
3) “Breath, anchor, brief, map—then the thing that bends rooms out of tune: distortion you can’t hear until you listen for it.”

## TODOs
- Add a one‑sentence linker to Ch2 opening.
- Track ‘Next Step Hint’ metrics in Ch8 (Rhythm Ledger) to close loop.
