# Inspiration

A 1‑minute reset between dense progressive tracks — a micro‑practice of presence: one breath, then arrive.

# Style Prompt

Minimalist interlude, no strict rhythm. Begin with the sound of breath layered into a soft drone. Add a single repeating piano note with long reverb, supported by a slow, opening‑and‑closing synth pad. Vocals are mostly spoken and whispered, short and sparse. No drums, no build — only atmosphere. End with the piano and synth fading into silence, like an exhale. Mood: meditative, intimate, grounding. Length: ~1 minute. Purpose: a reset between dense progressive tracks, embodying the “one‑breath reset” micro‑practice.

# Lyrics

[Intro – faint sound of inhaling, a low drone fades in like air moving through a pipe organ]

[Spoken, soft, spacious]
Stop.
One breath.
Here.

[Instrumental – 0:45 to 1:00]

[Closing – whisper over fading tones]
[Whispered]
See. Hear. Feel.
Arrive.
