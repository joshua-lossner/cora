# Inspiration

Choices that strengthen the field. A driving groove pushes the verses forward; the chorus sharpens into a clear refrain. Guitars bite harder here, but the core tone stays the same — alignment over force.

# Notes (optional)

- Consider a short rhythmic break before the final chorus to spotlight the hook.
