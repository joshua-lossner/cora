# Inspiration

Haunted circuits and kind machines. Let guitars mimic modem squeals and machine harmonics in feedback tails, but keep the core band sound organic. The hook frames technology as a new instrument in the universal mind.

# Notes (optional)

- Use eBow or sustained feedback to suggest “signal learning” without adding synths.
- Variation: replace [Bridge] with [Instrumental Break] (sustained eBow line over bass).
