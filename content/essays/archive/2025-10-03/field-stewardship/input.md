# Notes
- The field holds us; our actions tune it clearer or noisier.
- Examples: community norms; code review tone; doc hygiene; link rot patrols.
- Practical moves: weekly resonance check; prune broken links; steward tone.
- Micro-scene: meeting opens with breath + purpose; ends with one next move.
- Counterpoint: avoid heavy process; small, steady rituals over bureaucracy.
