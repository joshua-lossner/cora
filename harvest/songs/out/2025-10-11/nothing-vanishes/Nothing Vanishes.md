# Inspiration

Autumn leaves on a tenement roof; bodegas still lit. Stories of loss turn into new roots — nothing ends, it transforms. Three long verses trace a friend, a block, a self; compost cycle in human terms. Add a minimal two‑line refrain between verses, 4‑bar instrumental turnarounds, and an extended outro to land ~3:00 runtime.

# Style Prompt

1990s NYC boom‑bap at 88 BPM; mood reflective and somber with resilient undertone; dusty jazz/soul loop, punchy kick+snare, filtered bass, light vinyl hiss. Story format with minimal refrain: Intro → Verse 1 → [Refrain: 2 bars] → [Instrumental Break: 4 bars turnaround] → Verse 2 → Refrain → Instrumental Break → Verse 3 → Refrain → [Extended Outro: 8–12 bars]. Vocals: close‑mic narrative delivery; vivid, concrete imagery; memorable end‑lines. Aim ~3:00 runtime via turnarounds + extended outro. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy EDM risers, heavy autotune; vocal‑forward, dynamic master (no brickwall).

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Soft piano loop; wind over rooftop]

[Verse 1]
We chalked names on the mailbox, paint chipped, third floor,
Smoke rose from the vendor cart, rain pooled by the door.
He said the block remembers you, even when you dip,
Old heads pour a little out, stories on the lip.
I used to fear the endings, like a lock with missing keys,
But seasons taught a lesson in the rustle of the leaves —
What falls feeds what’s coming; it’s a long exchange of roles,
I tuck that truth like cash, folded quiet in my soul.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Instrumental Break]
[4‑bar turnaround on the loop]

[Verse 2]
We lost the bodega owner, but the awning stayed the same,
His nephew learned the register, kept the ledger with his name.
The chairs out on the sidewalk took the shape of missing friends,
We pass along their phrases till the grammar never ends.
I shelved the self I carried that was heavy, out of date,
Let rain erase the chalk lines, there’s a cleaner way to wait.
What changes ain’t a vanishing, it’s fabric getting sewn —
You trace the thread by living, that’s the only way it’s known.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Instrumental Break]
[4‑bar turnaround; add subtle scratches]

[Verse 3]
A cousin left for somewhere warm; he mails back winter coats,
We laugh at how we used to be, then turn it into notes.
I compost all my bravado, let the pride become the ground,
So something real can root in me and push a new sound.
You hear it in this record: dust and hiss that used to be
Some other song, some other scene, now breathing into me.
I’m learning how to honor what the world refuses to lose —
When nothing really vanishes, you rise by what you choose.

[Refrain]
Nothing vanishes — it transforms.
What falls feeds what’s coming on.

[Outro]
[Extended instrumental outro 8–12 bars; distant train; scratches echo “nothing… vanishes”]
