# Story Structure — Quick Reference

Use the smallest sufficient structure. Choose one model and commit.

Models
- Three‑Act: Setup → Confrontation → Resolution (inciting → midpoint → crisis → climax → denouement)
- Four‑Part: Part I (setup) / II (response) / III (attack) / IV (resolution)
- Hero’s Journey: Ordinary World → Call → Refusal → Mentor → Threshold → Trials → Ordeal → Reward → Return → Change

Scene/Sequel Rhythm
- Scene (goal → conflict → outcome) then Sequel (reaction → dilemma → decision).
- End scenes with a small open loop; start sequels with felt reaction.

Pacing Tips
- Chapters: 5–9 beats. Vary intensity (alternate breathers with pushes).
- Seed and payoff. Keep micro‑tension active in paragraphs.
