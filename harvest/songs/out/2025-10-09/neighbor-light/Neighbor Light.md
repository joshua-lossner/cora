# Inspiration
Streetlights on at dusk, porch steps full of shoes. Verses show small rituals—passing plates, fixing a latch, two hands on a heavy box. Chorus repeats the neighbor light refrain as the BGVs lift in simple harmony.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Be my neighbor light.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul at 82 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurli, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums with tambourine; communal baritone lead with small gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus], double [Chorus], and gentle ad‑lib [Outro]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Porch chatter; tambourine taps]

[Verse 1]
Pass a bowl from hand to hand,
Fix the latch, it’s loose again.
Neighbor’s back with moving string—
Two hands make a heavy thing.

[Pre‑Chorus]
What we keep is what we share,
Little lights in open air.

[Chorus]
Be my neighbor light,
Shine me home tonight.

[Verse 2]
Borrow sugar, trade a song,
Sweep the sidewalk where it’s long.
Leave a note, a number too—
I’m right here beside of you.

[Bridge]
[BGVs call and answer]
Windows glow on every street,
Love is where our footsteps meet.

[Chorus]
Be my neighbor light,
Shine me home tonight.

[Chorus]
Be my neighbor light,
Shine me home tonight.

[Outro]
[Ad‑libs; choir hum]
