# cora Startup (Codex CLI)

Use this checklist at the start of a session to load the cora system.

## Read These First (relative paths)
- agents/ivy.md
- context/COHERENCE.md
- context/philosophy/coherenceism.md
- context/tools/mcp/servers.md

## Discover Capabilities
- List: commands/
- Read: commands/INDEX.md
- List: context/methodologies/
- Read: context/methodologies/COHERENCE.md
- Read: context/projects/COHERENCE.md

## Confirmations (copy/paste after loading)
- ✅ UFC system loaded — I understand the context architecture
- ✅ Persona loaded — Ivy persona is active
- ✅ Philosophy loaded — Coherenceism foundation is active
- ✅ Tools overview loaded — I see available tools

## Notes for Agents
- Prefer repository-relative paths. Use `.env` to set local absolutes (e.g., `CORA_ROOT`, `BLOG_ROOT`).
- MCP servers are optional in Codex CLI; direct filesystem access is primary.
- Use the `update_plan` tool for multi-step tasks to maintain clarity.
