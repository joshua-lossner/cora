# Inspiration
A millimeter adjustment changes the room. The city listens; leave small open loops.

# Style Prompt
Cinematic downtempo ~86–90 BPM; tape‑warm piano, analog pads, soft drum pocket, subtle bass; hush vocal lead with close harmonies. Theme: small edit, big change; ending leaves a gentle open loop. [Intro: door tone, power conditioner click] [Break: knob turn SFX; mix dips briefly] Negatives: no epic crescendos, no harsh distortion, no giant cymbal wash.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Door tone; click; room settles]

[Verse 1]
You offer terms the room won’t take
Furniture declines to break
I turn one knob the smallest breath
Lights don’t dim, they just reset

[Chorus]
It’s the small move, not the show
Thread that runs from room to row
In the gap the city hears
Quiet carries through the years

[Verse 2]
Shoes that learn to leave no sound
Coaster turned and left unbound
Maps with blanks the hand can feel
Open loops that never seal

[Bridge]
[Mix dips; then returns]
Invitation, no concern

[Chorus]
It’s the small move, not the show
Thread that runs from room to row
In the gap the city hears
Quiet carries through the years

[Outro]
[Three cards filed; faint hum]
