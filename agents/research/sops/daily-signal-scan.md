# Daily Signal Scan

## Categories
- Technology, AI, Privacy/Security, Philosophy, Culture/Art, Society/Economy

## Steps
1. Sources — open 3–5 trusted feeds per category (newsletters, journals, trusted curators)
2. Filter — skip headlines; extract 1–2 patterns per category (what is shifting?)
3. Signals — write neutral, source-linked bullets (one line each)
4. Prompts — for each pattern, draft 1–2 prompts for posts (angle, question, implication)
5. Synthesis — pick 3 strongest cross-category connections

## Outputs
- signals.md — categorized bullets with links
- prompts.md — candidate angles/questions to inspire posts
