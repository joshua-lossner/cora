# Inspiration

A doorstep at dusk. You hold a mask in one hand, your face in the other. What do you offer when someone opens the door—the trick of pretense, or the treat of presence? This song explores reciprocity in relationship: what we wear, what we withhold, what we risk by showing up undefended. The gap between transaction and genuine exchange. The choice to arrive as ourselves.

# Style Prompt

Contemplative spiritual folk at 95 BPM with fingerpicked acoustic guitar, 432 Hz singing bowls, and warm synth pads. Clear female vocals, conversational and honest—not performative. Features a 2-second silence before the final chorus. No theatrical production, no forced positivity, no polished pop vocals.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Fingerpicked guitar, singing bowl fade-in]

[Verse 1]
I stand at your door with a plastic smile
Rehearsed my lines for the last half mile
You ask what I want, I say "just passing through"
But the truth costs more than I'm offering you

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this a trade or a reaching hand?
Am I here to take or to understand?

[Chorus]
Trick or treat, what did you come here for?
Are you wearing a mask or showing your core?
You can't receive what you won't let go
Give and receive—that's how the real things grow

[Verse 2]
You opened the door, but I stayed outside
Took what you gave and I ran and hide
Called it protection, called it being smart
But a closed fist can't hold an open heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Is this a trade or a reaching hand?
Am I here to flee or to take a stand?

[Chorus]
Trick or treat, what did you come here for?
Are you wearing a mask or showing your core?
You can't receive what you won't let go
Give and receive—that's how the real things grow

[Bridge]
[Sparse—just voice and singing bowl]
What if I took off the costume?
What if you saw the actual wound?
What if the gift is the giving itself—
No transaction, just presence, just showing yourself?

[Silence]
[2 seconds of quiet—just room tone]

[Chorus]
Trick or treat, I came here to be known
Not to perform, not to trick, just to be shown
I'll receive what you offer if you'll hold what I bring
Give and receive—that's the realest thing

[Outro]
[Fingerpicked guitar fading, singing bowl sustains]
The door stays open
The mask stays down
The treat was presence
All along

# Notes

- Include actual 2-second silence before final chorus (the pause before choosing authenticity)
- Singing bowl enters at intro and outro, threads subtly through choruses
- Pre-chorus is the moment of questioning—should be slightly uncertain, building
- Bridge strips down to voice and bowl—naked truth moment
- No forced resolution; outro is open, still arriving
