# Beats
- Vessa arrives loud; the room does nothing.
- Mara adjusts one knob by a hair; power dips.
- The signal traverses the gap; the city listens.
- Jae returns; not turned — quiet.
- They seed three new blanks into the public map.

# Chapter
Vessa arrived like a press release: confident, timed, bright. Her shoes were as quiet as rumored, and her watch caught the room’s light and polished it. “I have a proposal,” she said, to no one in particular and to everyone.

The room they’d chosen was not the velvet one; it was an ordinary office that had learned to subtract because two people had been careful in it. Vessa set her hand on the table the way people do when they expect furniture to agree. The table didn’t.

“We don’t accept,” Mara said, and heard how big that sounded. She disliked it immediately. She looked instead at the knob on the wall that controlled a power conditioner. It was a notch too high. She rolled it back a millimeter. The lights didn’t dim so much as they sighed.

In the gap that edit made, the channel she’d learned to open ran like a thread through two rooms, then a hallway, then the little kitchen with the mugs. Jae stood in the doorway as if he’d always been coming back and just needed the invitation phrased in a language he respected.

Vessa waited for speech she could record, and when it didn’t arrive, her face arranged itself into a polite shape that did not understand. “You’ll lose distribution,” she said at last, as if it were a weather warning. “You can’t scale this.”

“Good,” Jae said, not loud. He rotated a coaster a quarter turn and left it misaligned on purpose because sometimes you have to leave the scar visible to remember where not to cut.

Later, in the public map drawer, they slid three cards with blanks into the stacks where citizens grab transit help. No one announced them. The blanks sat and waited for people who already knew how to look, which is to say: anyone willing to try.
