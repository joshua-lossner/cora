# Inspiration

The room spins slowly through clouded vision. Sounds blur and muffle. The telescreen's voice becomes distant static. Time loses meaning in the haze. This is the numbed interval between broken and compliant, the drugged drift before total surrender. Low synth drones envelop everything. The surveillance ping, if present at all, is buried deep in the fog—no longer threatening because there's nothing left to threaten.

# Style Prompt

Ambient dark drone at 75 BPM; pure hazy atmosphere with no vocals. Thick low analog synth drones and hazy pads, distant muffled sounds (underwater quality), barely present minimal rhythm, enveloping static hum. No clarity, definition, or melodic content—focus on dissociation and numbness. Surveillance "ping" buried deep in fog if present at all. Create alcohol-induced haze, time dilation, drift before final surrender. No energy or forward movement—pure suspended dissociation.

# Lyrics

[Ambient Drift]
[Thick low synth drones envelop]
[Distant muffled sounds, underwater quality]

[Dissociated Float]
[Hazy pads layer in]
[Time dilates; barely present rhythm]
[Static hum thickens]
[Surveillance ping buried in fog]

[Fade]
[All elements blur together]
[Slow fade to near-silence]
[Transition to final track]
