# Inspiration

An unhurried, late‑night smooth jazz suite where each track traces a branch of Coherenceism. The palette is warm and breathable: Rhodes and upright bass under brushed drums, with tenor sax, flugelhorn, and clean guitar trading the melody. A simple three‑note “resonance motif” returns across the album—introduced softly on Track 1, reharmonized in the middle, and resolved in the closer. Dynamics stay gentle; nothing rushed, nothing forced.

Atmosphere: candle‑lit room, rain against a window, a city humming at a distance. The feel should invite presence—subtle tension that releases into ease—so the listener can exhale and stay. Keep solos lyrical and short; prioritize tone, space, and conversation between players over virtuosity. Let silence do some of the work.

# Notes (optional)

- Keep transients soft; no harsh cymbal wash.  
- Bass slightly forward for warmth; drums tucked with brushes.  
- Reuse the resonance motif (three notes) in heads and as a tag in outros.  
- Feature order to vary texture: sax leads early, guitar mid‑album, flugelhorn/vibes for color.  
- Sequencing arcs from “field‑wide” (Universal Mind) toward the intimate and practical (Living Coherence).

Structure
- Use `structure_default` for most tracks. Apply variations per the notes: occasional vibes feature, trio interlude, or extended outro to avoid sameness while preserving the album’s calm center.
