# Beats
- Night in the stacks; HVAC down; breath fogs.
- Boxes labeled “misc” carry consistent edges; hidden order.
- A reel catalogs pauses; addresses in gaps.
- Vessa surfaces as a rumor in memos.
- Mara learns the archive’s safe hours.

# Chapter
The air system slept and the building’s lungs made do. In the off hours the archive kept its own weather. Mara’s breath fogged a little and she felt suddenly visible to the books, as if her exhale stamped each aisle with a brief date.

Boxes marked MISC steadied her precisely because they lied. The corners lined up; the labels matched hand to hand; the weight in her arms told a pattern. She stacked two, nudged a third. The cart rolled a meter and clicked over a seam she couldn’t see — and had never noticed in day noise.

In a drawer she’d opened a dozen times, a reel waited in its round tin. Someone with a patient hand had written PAUSES on the lid. She threaded the tape and the player swallowed it with a small gratitude and a whirr. The voice on it sounded like no one she knew. Between phrases the recorder sat long enough that she almost thought it had stopped, and then the person read a time and the word ADDRESS out of order. She rewound; listened again. The space was the message.

Old memos in a manila folder used an initial for a contractor who complained about “signal leakage” in community rooms. The same initial boxed invoices with sums that felt round in a way real work rarely is. V. K. She imagined a watch that never made noise and shoes that swallowed their own steps.

She learned which hours the building approved of her: after power tests, before the morning crew turned on radios. Sixteen minutes at two a.m., nine minutes just after four, a slim window at the shift when buses on the east line went from late to early. The tape made her smile, then sober; it was older than she was, but the gaps still fit.

On her way out she left the reel where she’d found it and rolled the cart back past the desk where the radio sat with its broken antenna stitched in tape. She touched the knob and didn’t turn it. The tiny decision made her feel the way Jae’s hand had on her sleeve: not a stop, an alignment.
