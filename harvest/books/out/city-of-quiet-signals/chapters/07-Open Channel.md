# Chapter
The archive’s test cycle shivered the lights at 02:07, and the train she would have taken if she weren’t here hissed somewhere under the street at 02:08. It took three nights of writing times on her arm for her to see the lock and key they made.

She threaded the old reel again and let the recorded pauses measure the room. Address, the voice had said, as if a place could be made of nothing. She counted with it and at the count she raised her chest a fraction and held — not a dramatic hold, the kind swimmers brag about, but a tiny moment that honored a window.

Vessa’s trace, she suspected, was a mouth that eavesdropped. It wanted speech, the better to index and sell. She imagined it scanning rooms like this one and missing the bit where the room refused to speak.

She aligned her breath to the cycle and let her fingers rest on the radio knob like a reader marking a page. In the stacks a single LED on a power strip blinked out of time with itself — and then in time with her count. Once. She smiled so hard she felt ridiculous, then set the smile down like a cup.

“Open,” she said, barely, into the negative space between a hum and a click. The building answered with wood settling the way old houses do after a storm when everyone’s gone back to bed.
