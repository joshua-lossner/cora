# Beats
- Use a clarity × pull canvas; place ideas without debate.
- Plot real constraints by stakeholder.
- Show unknowns as fog; plan a probe.
- Choose moves that raise clarity or pull (not both at once).
- Snapshot and link; keep maps living.

# Chapter
You have a pitch and you have edges. Now you need a way to see where to stand so reality carries you. The resonance map is that view: a simple canvas where clarity meets pull, fog is honest, and the next small move announces itself without force.

You draw two axes—clarity on the horizontal, pull on the vertical—and keep them faint. Faint because the map is not the work; it is how the work reveals where it wants to go next.

Why a resonance map? Because plans grind when they ignore two questions: do we see this clearly, and does it pull people along without push? When both are high, motion is cheap. When either is low, you change where you stand, not who you are.

Canvas
```
Pull ↑
     |            ✳ (travels without push)
     |        
     |   • (clear but inert)         ✷ (loud, unclear)
     | 
     +————————————————————————→ Clarity
          fog ░░░░░░ (unknowns we will probe)
```

Place Without Debate
You tell the room: “Place ideas, pressures, or artifacts as dots. One sentence each. If it takes more, it’s fog.” You start with live candidates: the Next + Why hint, the permission clock, the past‑tense decision line, the ledger ritual. Someone places “Next + Why” high pull, mid‑clarity. Someone else places “permission clock” mid‑clarity, high pull for ops; fog for legal. The dots don’t settle arguments; they surface them at a scale you can act on.

Plot Real Constraints by Stakeholder
Maps get honest when constraints appear as contours, not excuses. You add light lines for stakeholders—support, design, eng, ops, legal/compliance, partner—and mark which dots pull whom. The same dot can sit high‑pull for support and low‑pull for legal. That’s not a fight; that’s a seam. You don’t fix seams with force. You move the dot by changing its clarity for the group with the lowest pull.

Show Fog and Plan a Probe
You shade fog where sentences stretch past a breath: “ecosystem,” “platform,” “delight,” “AI‑powered.” You don’t ban them. You draw fog, then plan probes to turn fog into contour. Probes are small: a single page with “Next,” a two‑line explain‑why, a safety note added to PRs. The point is not to argue the weather; it’s to step into it and learn which way the wind is blowing.

Choose Moves That Raise One Axis at a Time
Force is trying to raise clarity and pull at once. The map gives you a third option: pick one. If a dot sits clear but inert, place it next to a move that increases pull (make the signal cheaper to see at the moment of hesitation; attach a habit). If a dot sits noisy but compelling, increase clarity (write the past‑tense decision now; add explain‑why; move scope to OUT). You stop trying to do everything and start doing one thing that changes where the dot lives.

Snapshot and Link; Keep Maps Living
You never make a pretty map. You take a photo or capture a monospace sketch and paste it near the top of the doc, right below the brief and above the ledger. You link each dot to an artifact: a PR, a page, a decision record. Each week, you add one new snapshot and delete none. The map is a flipbook of how the field tuned itself.

Method — 15‑Minute Map
1) Draw the axes faint. Label Clarity →, Pull ↑.
2) Place five dots in silence (one sentence each). No debate.
3) Shade fog. Name two probes (owner, clock).
4) Pick one dot to move via clarity; one via pull. Owner + clock.
5) Snapshot the map; link probes and moves; write a past‑tense line.

Remote Variant — Monospace Map
You use a doc, not a whiteboard. Draw the axes in monospace. People paste bullets with coordinates (“CL 6/10, P 4/10 — ‘Next in docs’”). You translate coordinates into a rough ASCII map. You place fog as ░░░ and keep the ritual: no pitch; one sentence; owner and clock for probes and moves. You paste the map image at the top, then link artifacts. You end five minutes early because the room stops trying to win slides and starts placing dots.

Travel Map Overlay
Signals travel across roles (Chapter 3). The resonance map shows where they die. You draw a bus route—customer → support → product → design → engineering → ops → compliance—and put small station dots where handoffs occur. For each station, you copy the dot you care about (“Next + Why,” “Permission Clock”) and annotate where it loses clarity or pull. The next move is a sentence or artifact at the station where the signal dies. The map tells you where to stand; the route tells you which door to hold.

Edges Give Maps Teeth
Edges (Chapter 4) turn maps into decisions. For any dot you intend to move, draw a small boundary box beside it: IN/OUT, mode (consent/advice/mandate), owner/clock, past‑tense line. This prevents a map from becoming a poster. You stop when the box is filled and a link appears. The map is not an art project; it’s a menu of edges.

Examples — Two Maps

1) Onboarding Clarity Map
- Dots: “Start Here (Next + Why)”, “Rename labels X→Y”, “Explainer Carousel”, “Checklist after step 3”.
- Placement: Start Here high‑pull/mid‑clarity; Rename mid‑pull/high‑clarity; Carousel low‑clarity/mid‑pull (noise); Checklist mid‑clarity/mid‑pull.
- Fog: “Delight,” “Unified.”
- Moves: clarity for Start Here (add screenshot + past‑tense line); pull for Checklist (surface at hesitation); compost Carousel (noise).
- Outcome: “We added Start Here + Next/Why and surfaced Checklist at step 3; hesitations fell.”

2) Permissions Map
- Dots: “Permission Clock + Why,” “Appeals Link,” “Role Audit,” “Policy Rewrite.”
- Placement: Clock high‑pull/mid‑clarity; Appeals mid‑pull/mid‑clarity; Audit mid‑clarity/low‑pull; Rewrite fog/noise.
- Moves: clarity for Clock (security sign‑off in human words); pull for Appeals (link where decline happens); defer Rewrite (mandate, later).
- Outcome: “We added clock + why and appeals; time‑to‑decision ↓ 24%; escalations ↓ 11%.”

Visual Grammar — How to Draw Less, See More
- Faint axes; dots for items; ░ fog for unknowns; thin boxes for boundaries; arrows only for travel.
- No legends; the legend is your body: does this help you move?
- No perfect circles; asymmetry is honest.
- One label per dot; long labels go in the doc with the link.

Anti‑Patterns — Maps That Grind
- Beautiful posters that never ship. Retune: add a boundary box and a past‑tense line; link an artifact.
- Crowded maps. Retune: five dots, not fifty; retire dots that moved; compost the rest.
- Debating placement. Retune: one sentence → place → probe; debate only after a probe returns.
- KPI overlays that drown feeling. Retune: keep numbers in the ledger; the map earns them by making motion cheap.

Q&A — Common Map Questions
- “How precise is clarity vs pull?” Precise enough to choose. If you need decimals, you are avoiding the move.
- “Who places the dots?” Anyone. The owner guards the boundary; the room places the map.
- “Can a map be wrong?” Yes. That’s why probes exist. Be wrong small and early.
- “What if leadership wants a polished map?” Give them a photo and three past‑tense lines. If they still want polish, you have a governance question, not a mapping one.

Design Pattern — Map + Brief + Ledger
The holy trinity sits in this order at the top of a doc:
1) Brief: promise, pain, constraints, stakes (Tuesday words)
2) Map: current snapshot (image or monospace)
3) Ledger: hum of the week + retune chosen (owner/clock/stop)
Underneath: boundary boxes for live moves, decision records in past tense. This order prevents theater and preserves momentum.

Method — Probes That Teach
- Pick one foggy dot. Write a probe: “Two‑day test; owner; clock; what will we learn that the map can’t?”
- Keep probes at consent level. If someone claims mandate, ask for evidence of coupling/irreversibility.
- Write the past‑tense line you’ll post if the probe teaches what you hope.
- After, move the dot; don’t change the story, change the map.

Map Hygiene — Weekly
- Add one new snapshot; never redraw the past to look cleaner.
- Remove one dot that became habit (it moved off the map into life).
- Compost one pretty noise (place in a “compost” note with a one‑line lesson).
- Promote one foggy dot to probe or boundary.

Metrics That Matter (for this chapter)
- Dots moved per week (with boundary + decision record)
- Probe yield (probes that produced clarity or pull)
- Time‑to‑decision for mapped moves vs unmapped
- Cross‑team handoffs mapped vs ad‑hoc
- Fog turned to contour vs slogans retired

Transcripts (Short)
Facilitator: “Place five dots without talking.”
Room: (writes)
Facilitator: “Name fog; two probes.”
Room: “Ecosystem, platform.”
Facilitator: “One dot we move via clarity; one via pull.”
Room: “Past‑tense decision line; surface checklist at step 3.”
Facilitator: “Owner/clock. Snapshot. Done.”

Leader’s Corner — Don’t Sell the Map
Resist the urge to present a map as a victory. A living map makes you vulnerable: it shows fog and failure and the dignity of small moves. Leaders who tolerate that earn teams who can move without them. Replace slide‑selling with link‑posting. Say, “Here’s today’s snapshot. Here’s what we’ll try by Friday.” Then leave.

Rehearsal Tip — Learn to Draw Ugly
Practice a map on paper before a meeting. Draw faint axes. Place five fake dots. Shade fog. Pick one clarity move, one pull move. Write a past‑tense line. Take 10 minutes. When the real meeting begins, your hand knows the shape and your body knows when to stop.

Bridge — To Compost Cycles and Rhythm Ledger
Maps make endings visible. Compost Cycles (next) turns endings into nutrients. The Rhythm Ledger keeps the pulse honest: one map snapshot per week, one hum named, one retune chosen. The combination gives you direction and cadence without force.

Small Move: Draw a resonance map this week with only five dots. Name fog. Write two probes and two moves (one for clarity, one for pull). Snapshot and paste it at the top of the doc with links. End the meeting early if the next move appears.

Extended Cases — Maps That Changed the Week

Recruiting Pipeline Map
Hum: “We lose candidates between screen and onsite.” Brief: promise fewer dead ends for candidates; constraints: hiring committee cadence, interview load. Dots: “Decision email with why,” “Self‑schedule link,” “Role scope at top,” “Panel consistency.” Placement: decision email high‑pull/mid‑clarity; self‑schedule high‑pull/mid‑clarity; scope mid‑clarity/mid‑pull; panel low‑clarity/low‑pull. Fog: “culture add.” Moves: clarity for scope (two‑line role summary); pull for self‑schedule (calendar link in the first reply); probe panel consistency (rotate one role; publish rubric). Outcome: fewer back‑and‑forth messages, drop‑offs fell. The map made HR, hiring manager, and panel see the same field.

Data Retention Policy Map
Hum: “We are blocked by compliance.” Brief in Tuesday words. Dots: “Retention doc in human words,” “Redaction tool defaults,” “Access audit row,” “Legal sign‑off meeting.” Placement: doc mid‑clarity/high‑pull; defaults high‑pull/mid‑clarity for eng; audit mid‑clarity/low‑pull; sign‑off low‑clarity/high‑pull. Fog: “risk” (unlabeled). Move: clarity for audit (one‑line at top of the page: what we record, who sees it, for how long); pull for defaults (set safe default, slow the risky path). Outcome: faster decisions, less fear. The map let legal point at a dot and say “here,” not “no.”

Layered Maps — See Only What You Need
Base layer: clarity × pull with dots. Constraint layer: add light contours for team constraints (time, trust, money, mandates). Signal layer: place sentences of ease beside related dots. Edge layer: show boundary boxes for active moves. Probe layer: small triangles where experiments run. You toggle layers depending on the question. Overlays are minimal and semantic; they never turn the map into a dashboard.

Isobars and Isochrones (if you must draw lines)
If you insist on lines, make them honest. Isobars show pressure (many constraints overlapping). Isochrones show time to ship (edges that match a given clock). You use them sparingly to avoid lying to yourselves. Lines are not truth; they are a hypothesis you agree to test.

Second Map — Risk × Reversibility (tiny)
Some edges live better on a second axis set: risk vs reversibility. You sketch a 2×2 the size of a postcard for one move. High‑risk, low‑reversible moves likely need mandate and heavier evidence; low‑risk, high‑reversible moves should live under consent. This companion map prevents arguments about “importance” by changing the question to safety.

Portfolio Overlay — Many Edges, One Field
When a team runs several edges at once, you paste small thumbnails of each edge’s map into a single “portfolio” doc. You do not combine them into a big soup; you show small maps side by side and write one sentence: “This quarter we move three dots by clarity, two by pull, and retire two as compost.” The overlay guards against scattered effort by making the pattern visible.

Map Rituals — Daily/Weekly/Monthly
- Daily: five‑minute check at standup — one new dot, one probe update, one dot retired.
- Weekly: snapshot added; ledger hum named; one move chosen; one compost note written.
- Monthly: review fog that stayed fog; decide whether courage or evidence is missing; prune maps that became posters.

Tooling Tips — Keep It Human
- Don’t use a whiteboard app that makes maps feel like design projects; use docs and photos.
- Keep images light (no drop shadows, no frames). Black marker on white background is honest.
- Prefer files over SaaS when possible; maps should open on any machine a year from now.

Anti‑Patterns (Deeper) — What To Do Instead
- Velocity theater: “Add more dots!” Fix: cap at five; retire one for each added.
- Consensus cartography: maps only change when all agree. Fix: consent for placement; mandate only for safety.
- Deck gravity: maps get copied into slides and frozen. Fix: link photos; forbid redraws; snapshots only.
- Ownership fog: no one owns a dot. Fix: dots don’t need owners; edges do. Add a box or remove the dot.

Q&A (More)
- “Can we plot KPIs directly?” Plot the moves that create signals; keep KPIs in the ledger. Otherwise you will push numbers instead of following pull.
- “What if our map is always fog?” Good. You just learned that your field needs probes, not arguments. Add two triangles and go touch reality.
- “Can maps be public?” Yes—redact secrets. Public maps teach adjacent teams where to meet you.

Practice Prompts
- Map an outcome that matters this month (five dots). Name one fog and one probe. Post the snapshot.
- Ask a neighbor team to place one dot on your map. Compare. What did you miss?
- Remove one pretty dot and add one lived sentence from a user or operator.

Workshop — 30‑Minute Mapping
1) Five dots in five minutes (silent)
2) Fog + two probes (five minutes)
3) Pick two moves (clarity, pull) (five minutes)
4) Edge boxes (five minutes)
5) Snapshot + links + past‑tense line (five minutes)
6) Calendar two check‑ins (five minutes)

Leader’s Anti‑Patterns (and how to help)
- Map as mandate: top‑down placement. Help: ask for two probes and one consent‑level move instead.
- Map as report: weekly show‑and‑tell. Help: insist on past‑tense lines and links.
- Map as branding: colors and fonts. Help: black marker law; maps are for movement, not memory.

Portfolio Case — From Ten Projects to Three Moves
A company had ten “priorities.” On a single portfolio page, they placed a thumbnail map for each. The same three dots reappeared: Next + Why, Permission Clock, Past‑Tense Decisions. They killed seven projects, moved three dots, and wrote three past‑tense lines. Revenue followed not because of a slogan, but because friction fell and people could breathe.

Map Smells — Quick Diagnostic
- If you can’t tell what changed since last week, you’re journaling, not mapping.
- If every dot moves toward the top‑right every week, you’re LARPing; real moves include retreats.
- If the map hurts to look at, good. Maps that sting teach.

Tool Snippets
- “Decision (past): We <did> <what> because <why>. Owner <name>. Clock <date>. Links: <…>.”
- “Probe: We will learn <X> by <Y>; owner <name>; clock <date>; past‑tense line <…>.”

Design — Map in UI
Place the map in the tools you use: a small widget in the doc template; a README section in the repo; a footer in the project brief. The goal is not another place to check; it’s one place that contains the three rails.

Governance Pack — When Escalation Is Healthy
If a dot touches many edges and lives in high‑risk/low‑reversible territory, prepare a one‑page pack: KNOW/INFER/IMAGINE bullets, a current map snapshot, two probe results, and an edge box proposal. Ask for mandate with evidence; propose consent for reversible parts. Your tone stays human; your map stays alive.

Coda — Draw Less, Move More
You learn to stop perfecting circles and start placing dots. You stop selling future states and start recording past‑tense moves. The map doesn’t make you brave; it makes bravery cheap.

Metrics Wall — Map Signals (lightweight)
- Dots moved/week (with boundary + link)
- Probes shipped/week (and yield)
- Fog→contour conversions/week
- Handoffs improved (before/after example count)
- Maps snapshot cadence (weekly on time?)
Post four numbers on a wall or doc footer. If they drift, ask “what did we stop seeing?” not “who messed up?”

Flow Check — Threads Across Chapters
Threads enter here from 1–5: listening field (breath→anchor→brief), distortion hygiene (hum→type→evidence), signals (sentences of ease), edges (IN/OUT/mode/owner/clock), tone (clear pitch). Threads exit toward 7–8: compost (retire dots with a one‑line lesson), rhythm (weekly snapshot cadence). Linkers to use:
- “A dot that stops moving becomes compost.”
- “A weekly snapshot becomes a ledger row.”

Team‑of‑Teams Overlay — Federated Maps
Each team keeps its own small map. Once a month, team leads paste snapshots into a single doc and write three sentences: what became clearer, what pulled harder, what died and fed the rest. No slides; three past‑tense lines. Federated maps respect sovereignty while aligning the field.

Before/After — Two Snapshots
Before (week 1):
```
Pull ↑          ✷ “Unified”
     |      ░░░ “ecosystem”
     |   • Rename X→Y
     |          • Start Here (unclear)
     +————————————————————————→ Clarity
```
After (week 4):
```
Pull ↑           ✳ Start Here (Next+Why)
     |    • Checklist @ step 3
     | ░ (ecosystem shrank; probe ready)
     |   (carousel composted)
     +————————————————————————→ Clarity
```
The value isn’t the art; it’s that the after snapshot links to a diff, a page, and a decision line.

Email Templates — Map Check‑ins
Subject: Map snapshot — <date>

Hi <team>,
Snapshot attached. Dots moved: <2>. Probes shipped: <1>. Fog→contour: <1>. Next two moves: <clarity move>, <pull move>. Decision (past): <one line>. Links: <map/brief/ledger>.
— <you>

Subject: Request: one dot from you

Hi <neighbor>,
Place one dot on our map from your view (one sentence). What would raise clarity or pull for you? We’ll link back to your artifact.
— <you>

Personal Map — One Life, Five Dots
You can map your own week. Five dots: sleep, writing, movement, relationships, distractions. Fog: “news,” “doomscroll.” Moves: clarity (turn off one feed), pull (walk with a friend). The map is the same: stop arguing yourself and place where you need to stand.

Scripts — Retunes on the Wall
- “We’re debating placement. Probe then place.”
- “Fog is fine. We just need a triangle.”
- “Pick clarity or pull. Not both.”
- “Edge box or compost.”
- “Past tense or it didn’t happen.”

Edge Interplay — Box Next to Dot
Make a habit of drawing a tiny boundary box next to any dot you intend to move. It forces you to state IN/OUT, pick a mode, and write a past‑tense line. The dot is the idea; the box is the move; the link is the proof.

Map Library — Reuse Shapes
Keep a folder of past maps (images + dot logs + outcomes). When a similar problem appears, you pull a shape, not a solution. The shape saves you from empty invention and from stale repetition. You tune to the current field with a known instrument.

“Show Me” Questions — Anti‑Theater Prompts
- Show me the snapshot.
- Show me the edge box.
- Show me the past‑tense line.
- Show me a dot you retired and what it fed.
If someone can’t show you, they might be performing progress. If they can, they’re mapping.

Design — Color, If You Must
If you must use color, use it to indicate layers (signals, probes, edges), not to decorate. Keep contrast for accessibility. Never use color to encode virtue (green good, red bad); maps are not mood boards.

Coaching Corner — When Teams Resist Maps
Some teams will say mapping slows them down. Agree, then prove speed. Take 15 minutes to map five dots and ship one consent‑level move by Friday. When the past‑tense line appears with a screenshot, ask whether the 15 minutes cost or saved time. Don’t argue. Keep showing it.

Map Debt — Pay It Down
If you haven’t snapshotted in three weeks, your map isn’t alive. Don’t backfill. Paste one ugly snapshot today, retire one dot, add one probe, and write one past‑tense line. Start the beat again. Debt pays down with repetition, not drama.

Workshop Transcript (longer)
Facilitator: “Five dots. One sentence each. Silence.”
Room: (places)
Skeptic: “We’re still guessing about partner behavior.”
Facilitator: “Fog. Probe?”
Engineer: “Two calls tagged with suggested channel; explain‑why.”
Facilitator: “Owner/clock?”
Ops: “Me. Friday.”
Facilitator: “Pick clarity or pull.”
Designer: “Clarity: write past‑tense line now.”
Facilitator: “Write it.”
Room: “We shipped 25% hint + explain‑why because it reduces reopens.”
Facilitator: “Snapshot. Done.”

From Map to Compost — Gentle Endings
When a dot becomes ritual (habit), remove it from the map and place it in a “living” list. When a dot refuses to move after three weeks, compost it with a one‑line lesson and a link to what it fed. Either way, the map thins to leave space for what wants to move.

Bridge — Rhythm Ledger (next)
Turn the weekly map snapshot into a ledger row: hum, retune, owner, clock, stop criteria. Over time, the ledger proves that your map wasn’t mood—it became motion. You hear the field learn.

Mini Case — Compliance Onboarding Map
Context: New vendors need to complete a security review. The process stalls and causes resentment. Brief: fewer dead ends for vendors and fewer surprises for security. Dots: “Plain‑language checklist with why,” “One visible clock,” “Example artifacts,” “Appeals path,” “Slack concierge.” Placement: checklist mid‑clarity/high‑pull; clock high‑pull/mid‑clarity; examples mid‑pull/mid‑clarity; appeals mid‑clarity/mid‑pull; concierge high‑pull/low‑clarity (fragile). Fog: “risk appetite.” Moves: clarity for concierge (move from people to doc; add hours, scope, link); pull for examples (place where people hesitate). Probe: two vendors try the new checklist; measure back‑and‑forth. Past‑tense line: “We published a plain checklist with examples and a visible clock; back‑and‑forth ↓ 30%; security reviews felt less adversarial.” The map didn’t solve risk; it made safety legible.

Practice — Signal → Map Sprint (20 minutes)
1) Collect three sentences of ease from the last two weeks.
2) For each, place a dot where the sentence belongs (docs, UI, triage, review).
3) Shade fog around any sentence that feels fragile (depends on a hero).
4) Pick one dot to move by clarity (write the past‑tense line now) and one by pull (put the sentence where the next person hesitates).
5) Snapshot and link. Calendar two check‑ins. End early if your body says “we can stop.”

Leader Close — The Three Lines You Say
- “Here’s the map (snapshot).”
- “Here’s what we’ll move by Friday (past‑tense line).”
- “Here’s how you’ll know (link).”
No campaign. No sermon. Three lines and quiet confidence.

Coda — A Map You Can Trust
Trust doesn’t come from pretty diagrams. It comes from a small map that tells the truth about fog, names the next move, and shows its receipts next week. Draw faint axes. Place five dots. Move two. Compost one. Repeat. This isn’t a method to admire; it’s a way to keep faith with the work and the people who do it.
