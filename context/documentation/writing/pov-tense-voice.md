# POV, Tense, and Voice — Practical Rails

POV
- First person: intimate but narrow. Avoid head‑hopping.
- Third‑limited: close access to one character at a time. Scene‑level POV changes only at clear breaks.
- Omniscient: authorial distance; use sparingly for modern feel.

Tense
- Past: default for flexibility.
- Present: immediacy; mind drift into past perfect for backstory.

Voice
- Diction: register (plain → lyrical). Choose constraints.
- Cadence: sentence length mix and imagery density.
- Distance: close/medium/distant; adjust for emotion and clarity.

Devices
- Free indirect style; scene/sequel; selective interiority; restrained metaphors.

Negatives
- No head‑hopping; avoid exposition dumps; keep backstory brief and purposeful.
