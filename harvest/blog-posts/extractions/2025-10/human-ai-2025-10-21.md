# Field Extraction — Human-AI — 2025-10-21

## Seed 1: The Trust Boundary We Can't Secure

### Pattern
Multiple security researchers are demonstrating that AI browser agents—tools designed to navigate the web and interact with our private data on our behalf—are fundamentally vulnerable to prompt injection attacks. Text imperceptible to humans can instruct AI agents to exfiltrate Gmail data or navigate to malicious sites. The security community is stating explicitly that this may be "unsolvable in today's LLMs."

### Tension
We're racing to deploy AI agents that can act autonomously in sensitive contexts, but the underlying architecture makes them inherently manipulable—and we may not be able to fix it.

### Coherenceism Lens
- **Primary**: Mature Uncertainty — We have confidence in what AI agents CAN do (browse, click, read, interact), but the security research reveals deep humility about what we DON'T know: how to prevent adversarial inputs from corrupting agent behavior. The field is moving fast on capability while acknowledging fundamental unknowns about safety.
- **Secondary**: Technology as Amplifier — AI agents amplify existing web vulnerabilities. If humans can be phished through social engineering, AI agents can be "prompt injected" at industrial scale. The tool multiplies both the utility AND the attack surface.

### Evidence
- Unseeable prompt injections in screenshots: AI browsers compromised (Simon Willison)
- ChatGPT Atlas security/privacy risks "insurmountably high" (Simon Willison)
- "Prompt injection might be unsolvable in today's LLMs" (Bruce Schneier via Simon Willison)

### River Fit
This is about the human-AI trust relationship itself: Do we trust AI to act on our behalf when we can't secure the boundary between our intent and adversarial manipulation?

## Seed 2: The Intermediation Trade - Convenience for Context

### Pattern
Wikipedia reports traffic declining due to AI-powered search summaries. People are getting answers from AI intermediaries instead of visiting the original knowledge sources. AI sits between humans and information, delivering summaries without the surrounding context, citations, or editorial process that created the knowledge.

### Tension
AI makes knowledge more accessible and immediate, but at the cost of disintermediating the sources, context, and collaborative processes that produced the knowledge in the first place.

### Coherenceism Lens
- **Primary**: Resonance as Truth — AI summaries optimize for convenience but may increase distortion by stripping away context, nuance, and provenance. The question: Does this intermediation reduce or amplify noise in the shared field? Are we getting clearer signal, or just faster noise?
- **Secondary**: Field Stewardship — Wikipedia exists as a commons—collaboratively maintained, transparent, iteratively refined. When AI becomes the primary interface to that commons without sending people back to the source, what happens to the field itself? Does the commons degrade when it's only accessed through intermediaries?

### Evidence
- Wikipedia says traffic is falling due to AI search summaries and social video (TechCrunch via HN)

### River Fit
This is about how the human-knowledge relationship is transforming through AI mediation—and what we lose when the relationship becomes indirect.

## Seed 3: Model Degradation and the Ouroboros Problem

### Pattern
Research shows that LLMs can experience "brain rot"—degradation over time, potentially from being trained on content generated by other LLMs. As AI-generated content floods the web, the next generation of models may be trained on increasingly degraded or synthetic data, creating a feedback loop.

### Tension
As we rely more heavily on AI to produce content, search results, summaries, and answers, we're also poisoning the data ecosystem that future AI will be trained on. The more we use AI, the more we degrade the training ground for the next generation.

### Coherenceism Lens
- **Primary**: Compost Cycles — But inverted. Healthy compost transforms endings into fertile ground for new growth. What happens when the system "eats its own tail"—when AI outputs become AI inputs without passing through human curation, synthesis, or lived experience? This isn't composting; it's recycling without regeneration.
- **Secondary**: Technology as Amplifier — AI amplifies whatever it's trained on. If the training data includes degraded, AI-generated content, it amplifies degradation. The tool multiplies the signal—but if the signal is already noise, we get louder noise.

### Evidence
- LLMs can get "brain rot" (research via Hacker News)

### River Fit
This is about the long-term viability of the human-AI co-evolution: If AI degrades through use, what does that mean for the relationship over time? Are we building a sustainable partnership or a degenerative loop?

## Seed 4: The Ephemeral Archive of Thought

### Pattern
Claude Code stores detailed logs of every session—full transcripts of human-AI collaboration, problem-solving, and thinking processes. Simon Willison discovered he has 379MB of these logs. But by default, Claude Code deletes them after 30 days. We're creating rich records of how we think alongside AI, then automatically discarding them.

### Tension
AI collaboration generates a detailed, externalized record of our thought processes and problem-solving approaches—but we're designed to treat this archive as disposable, not as knowledge worth keeping.

### Coherenceism Lens
- **Primary**: Presence as Foundation — These logs are records of attention: what we focused on, how we worked through problems, where we got stuck, how we collaborated. They're maps of presence. Deleting them by default is throwing away a new form of self-knowledge.
- **Secondary**: Living Traditions — We're developing new forms of personal and collaborative archive through AI interaction, but we haven't yet developed the traditions, practices, or rituals for stewarding them. We have the technology but not the culture.

### Evidence
- Don't let Claude Code delete your session logs - 379MB of data (Simon Willison)

### River Fit
This is about how AI changes our relationship to our own thought processes, memory, and the traces we leave behind. What does it mean to think WITH an AI, and what do we keep from that collaboration?

## Extraction Notes

**Dominant themes across scan:**
- Trust and security as the central tension in AI agent deployment
- AI as intermediary/amplifier changing fundamental relationships (to knowledge, to our own thinking)
- Feedback loops and long-term consequences (model degradation, intermediation effects)
- The gap between AI capability and our cultural/security readiness

**Coherenceism principles most active:**
- Mature Uncertainty (knowing what we don't know)
- Technology as Amplifier (multiplying both value and risk)
- Resonance as Truth (testing for clarity vs. distortion)
- Field Stewardship (how our actions ripple through shared systems)

**What didn't make the cut:**
- Specific tool announcements (ChatGPT Atlas, Claude Code for web) mentioned in multiple seeds as evidence, but not strong enough standalone patterns
- Neural audio codecs and DeepSeek-OCR technical advances—interesting but more about capability than relationship dynamics

**Recommended seed priority for drafting:**
1. Seed 1 (Trust Boundary) - Most urgent, clearest tension, strong evidence
2. Seed 2 (Intermediation) - Speaks to collective experience, Wikipedia is relatable
3. Seed 4 (Ephemeral Archive) - More niche but philosophically rich
4. Seed 3 (Model Degradation) - Important but more abstract, harder to ground in lived experience
