# Active Focus

## Purpose
Provide a single, live page for what is actively in focus so work remains coordinated and small.

## Scope & Rules
- Present tense; only the top 3 foci.
- Small, incremental moves; link to artifacts.
- Update date on edit; archive completed items to keep signal high.

## Focus (Today)
- [ ] Seed strategy and methodologies linked to existing procedures
- [ ] Register forest scaffold and integrity rules
- [ ] Exercise `essay_from_notes` on a sample to validate chains

## Constraints
- Preserve UFC as canonical; no destructive edits without escalation.
- Relative paths throughout; vendor-neutral language.
- Prefer chaining procedures over bespoke steps.

## Checkpoints
- Next review: YYYY-MM-DD
- Links to artifacts: add as bullets under each focus item when created

## Failure Modes (remedies)
- SCOPE_CREEP → reduce to next minimal step; move extras to backlog.
- STALE_FOCUS → set weekly reminder; prune or complete.
- HIDDEN_WORK → link artifacts and commits inline; keep traceability.

## Provenance
- Created: 2025-10-02 by Codex (CORA agent)
- Related: `agents/COHERENCE.md`, `workflows/essay_from_notes.yml`
- Notes: replace placeholders with live dates and links
