# Inspiration
Quiet attention together: small domestic images leading to a wide, breathy post‑chorus tag (one‑breath motif). Keep it close, human, and warm.

# Notes (optional)
Let acoustic guitar glisten in the post‑chorus; keep ad‑libs tasteful and sparse.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band mid‑tempo at 96 BPM. Soft pop kit with claps, lush pads, shimmer acoustic, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked but airy harmonies. Intimate verses; spacious post‑chorus “one‑breath” tag. No harsh distortion or heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Acoustic shimmer; soft pad]

[Verse 1]
Mugs on the counter, steam in the light,
Quiet as snowfall late in the night.
The room gets kinder when we don’t rush through—
I want to be here with you.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Put down the future, let the moment in,
Name what you feel, even if it’s thin.

[Chorus]
Be here with you,
Nothing more to prove.
I hear the world get true
When I’m here with you.

[Verse 2]
Bare feet on tile, the fridge humming low,
The city keeps buzzing, we let it go.
We make a quiet that the whole house knows—
Staying is how it grows.

[Bridge]
[Harmony stack; soft clap build]
One slow breath, and the room decides—
Every small thing falls in time.

[Chorus]
Be here with you,
Nothing more to prove.
I hear the world get true
When I’m here with you.

[Post‑Chorus]
Haaa—one breath in, one breath through.

[Outro]
[Acoustic hold; pad tails]
