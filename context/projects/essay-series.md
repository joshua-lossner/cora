# Essay Series — Coherence in Practice

## Purpose
Write a series of short, coherent essays that translate Coherenceism into lived practice — concrete images, tiny scenes, and forward‑looking moves. Build a reusable pipeline from notes → outline → draft → check → refine → final.

## Scope
- Length: ~5 minutes per essay
- Audience: knowledge workers burnt by hustle culture; builders seeking clarity
- Tone: reflective, unsentimental; voice carries, citations as footnotes

## Pipeline
- Workflow: `workflows/essay_from_notes.md:1`
- Inputs: `content/essays/in/`
- Outputs: `content/essays/out/`

## Tasks (Summary)
- [ ] context/project-tasks/essay-series/prepare-inputs.md:1
- [ ] context/project-tasks/essay-series/outline-first-essay.md:1
- [ ] context/project-tasks/essay-series/draft-first-essay.md:1
- [ ] Fact check (≥ 3 claims to (F))
- [ ] Refine style and cadence; footnotes-first
- [ ] Compile final.md / final.pdf
- [ ] If canon-worthy, add a leaf under `coherenceism/leaves/`

## Next Small Moves
- Add one new input under `content/essays/in/` with frontmatter and notes.
- Run the workflow step‑by‑step via the “Operator Prompt” pages.
- Capture claims and sources for the Money section’s numeric example.

## Candidate Topics
- Comfort vs. Coherence at Work (hook: the second cookie; midnight scroll)
- Boundaries Make Freedom (relationships scene: the knot carried; boundary voiced)
- Presence Beats Productivity (practice scene: one‑breath reset before sending)

## Links
- Canon root: `coherenceism/roots/coherenceism-root.md:1`
- Leaves (examples):
  - `coherenceism/leaves/primer-coherenceism.md:1`

## Notes
- Preserve labels (F/I/U) through refine; upgrade ≥ 3 claims to (F) with resolving citations.
- End each essay with a small, daily, forward‑looking choice.
