## Focus Areas

This river tracks:
- **Methods & workflows**: Reproducible practices that increase coherence
- **Tools & infrastructure**: Technology that empowers action
- **Practical empowerment**: Can someone reuse this tomorrow?
- **Build once, use forever**: Permanent capabilities

## Inclusion Test
Can someone reuse this tomorrow to act with more coherence?

## Extraction Guidance
Look for:
- Reusable methods, frameworks, workflows
- Tool innovations that increase agency
- Practical techniques for navigating complexity
- Stories of "I built this thing and now I can..."
- Patterns that reduce friction and increase clarity

Coherenceism principles most relevant:
- Build Once, Use Forever (permanent capabilities)
- Alignment over Force (position so reality carries the work)
- Presence as Foundation (attention reveals and maintains patterns)
- Technology as Amplifier (tune for harmony)
