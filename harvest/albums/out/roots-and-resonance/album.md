# Concept

A roots‑forward reggae record that carries Coherenceism’s center: one‑drop drums, deep round bass, and the steady lift of upstroke guitar and organ bubble. Horns and melodica thread a simple resonance motif across the set; dub is a technique, not a flood—spring reverb and tape echo open space without washing out the voice. The arc moves from wide‑field awareness toward the intimate and practical. Tempos stay easy (72–90 BPM); the feel is grounded, hopeful, and unhurried.

# Tracklist
1. One Field, One Heartbeat — one field, one heartbeat
2. Compost the Endings — compost the endings into life
3. Ride, Don’t Force — ride the wave, don’t force
4. One Breath, One Drop — one‑breath, one‑drop
5. Next True Thing — do the next true thing
6. Many Hands, One Sound — many hands, one sound
7. Teach the Wire to Sing — teach the wire to sing
8. Sweet Unknown — sweet unknown, steady light
9. Thread by Thread — small daily threads that endure

# Notes

- Bass forward and round; kick soft; cross‑stick on 2 & 4.
- Let the groove breathe; avoid dense fills; feel over flash.
- Reuse the resonance motif as horn tag, melodica hook, or echo send.
- Sequence flows field‑wide → intimate; closer resolves with a dub‑tag fade.

# Inspiration

A roots‑forward reggae album that carries Coherenceism’s tone: low, warm bass and an easy one‑drop that leaves space for breath. Upstroke guitar and organ bubble keep the pocket steady while horn lines and a melodica hook thread a simple two‑ or three‑note “resonance motif” across songs. Dub is a technique, not the destination: tasteful spring reverb and tape echo open pockets without drowning the message.

Images: late golden hour on a veranda; sea breeze through lace curtains; distant street sounds; children laughing between verses. Each track refracts a branch theme in plain language and grounded scenes — clear enough to sing along, spacious enough to sit inside.

Structure
- Use `structure_default` on most tracks. Apply variations via horns features, melodica solos, a Nyabinghi interlude, or an extended dub outro to add movement while preserving calm center.
