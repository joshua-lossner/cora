# Beats
- Define a coherent signal (low effort to spread; high pull).
- Test novelty vs resonance with a small circle.
- Track how a signal travels across roles.
- Prune pretty noise that doesn’t move work forward.
- Record the signal in a durable artifact.

# Chapter
Now that the hum has a name, you can hear which tones carry and which are just loud.

You keep the room in the same stance: one breath, brief on the table, axes faint on the board. “We’re going to separate signals from noise,” you say, “so we can choose moves that don’t require push.” People nod because they want that—work that moves on its own—though most have spent their careers learning to push.

Define a signal before you start hunting: low effort to spread, high pull once seen, repeats without you in the room. Not novelty. Not volume. Not a title slide that says “Unified” with a stock image of hands.

You give three examples that don’t need applause to travel:
- A tiny message that says what happens next, exactly when someone is about to hesitate.
- A single place, visible to all, where a decision lives in past tense with why.
- A tool affordance that makes the right choice the default and the wrong choice mildly inconvenient.

Noise has its own list. It’s the pretty thing that asks for attention without giving it back as progress: slogans that don’t steer, dashboards that summarize what no one needs to decide, performative collabs that add co‑owners and subtract owners.

Method — Signal Tests (5 minutes)
1) Five‑person loop: tell the idea to five people in different roles (support, design, eng, ops, a customer proxy). If they repeat it back unprompted, it’s candidate signal.
2) Resistance drop: does the idea reduce effort where effort accumulates? (seconds saved; fewer reopens; fewer “where do I…”s.)
3) Travel map: does the idea move across roles without translation? If it needs a pitch deck to cross the hall, it’s noise or not ready.
4) Pull check: after one exposure, do people ask for it again? If yes, that’s pull. If no, that’s marketing.
5) Snapshot: can you capture it in one screenshot or paragraph that reads as past tense?

Case — The Hint That Didn’t Need a Memo
You test the “Next Step Hint” on 10% traffic. The support lead reports two calls where the hint quietly did its job. No one writes a thread celebrating it. Instead, the calls didn’t happen. Negative space is hard to notice, so you write a one‑line decision record: “We shipped a 10% hint; first signals show fewer hesitations; expanding to 25% Friday.” People pick it up because it helps. Product says, “Can I have it in onboarding?” Ops says, “Can we surface it in triage?” Engineering shrugs and says, “It’s cheap.” That shrug is a compliment.

Novelty confuses teams. A novel thing is shiny; a resonant thing is inevitable. The test: if you stop talking, does the thing keep going? Novelty deflates into a slide; resonance turns into a sentence people say to each other without needing you there.

You draw a tiny scorecard to calm the people who need a number:

Resonance Scorecard (rough)
- Repeat rate: how often do we hear the idea back unprompted? (target: 3+ in a week)
- Effort delta: what strain does it remove? (time saved, dead ends removed, reopens reduced)
- Cross‑role carry: does it move across design/eng/support with the same sentence?
- Decision speed: does it create owners/clocks faster?
- Quiet lanes: does it silently reduce attention tax (fewer check‑ins, fewer pings)?

You caution against turning the scorecard into a game. “If we start optimizing for the number instead of the feeling of ease,” you say, “we’ll recreate theater with math.” The room breathes and someone writes “don’t game the feeling” in the margin like a dare.

Signals often hide in small sentences. A support agent writes, “I didn’t have to ask.” A designer says, “I saw what would happen if I clicked.” A new hire says, “I knew where to start.” You collect these like shells and lay them on the table. Each is a clue to a move that won’t need pushing.

Noise announces itself by demanding attention. It arrives as a demo, a deck, a story about a competitor, a spell that works on executives and not on Tuesday. You respect noise because it teaches you what not to ship. When a room has the courage to discard a pretty thing, it grows a spine.

Remote Variant — Signals in Threads
In a distributed team, signals show up in the places where people ask for help. You search your channels for sentences that start with “I didn’t have to…,” “It told me…,” “I found…,” “I knew….” You gather them into a page titled “Signals We Want More Of.” You paste two into the brief. Then you test one—without ceremony—by making the affordance that produced the sentence more visible. If the phrase appears more often next week, you’re close. If not, you learn and move.

Anti‑Patterns — How We Confuse Ourselves
- Loud novelty: a flashy demo that forces applause but doesn’t reduce any pain. Fix: don’t ship applause; ship small moves and collect evidence of ease.
- Vanity metrics: a chart that spikes because you changed the CTA color on a page that leads nowhere. Fix: measure decisions made, errors avoided, or time‑to‑helpful instead.
- Proxy worship: “engagement” without intent; “views” without comprehension. Fix: ask for the Tuesday sentence. If no one can say it, it’s noise.
- Copycat resonance: importing someone else’s signal into a field with different gravity. Fix: test with your own five‑person loop; your context decides what carries.

You’re careful to honor the thing noise protects: desire. People want to be part of something that moves. You don’t shame that; you redirect it to something that actually moves.

From Hint to Habit
You ask, “If this is a signal, what habit would keep it?” The answer is rarely “another meeting.” It might be a pattern: write the past‑tense decision in one sentence; add owners/clocks; add a screenshot; paste under the doc title. It might be a small change to a template; it might be changing the default option in a menu. Signals become durable when they’re tied to a habit that costs less than the attention it saves.

Travel Maps — Follow the Signal Across Roles
You sketch a simple route on the board like a bus map: customer → support → product → design → engineering → operations. “Tell me where the signal dies,” you say. The ops lead points to the handoff between support and product. The designer points to a Figma file that never updates the admin panel. The engineer points to a brittle permission layer. You circle the weak link and choose the smallest move that keeps the signal alive across it. Often this is not a build; it’s a sentence written in the right place.

Case — Code Review Signal
In engineering, you hunt for a phrase that reduces grind: “I knew this change was safe to ship.” You test a tiny affordance: require authors to include a “safety note” (tests, rollback, visibility) and reviewers to include a “risk note” (coupling, migration). The next week, time‑to‑merge improves. No one writes a thread claiming victory; they just stop arguing about nits and talk about risk. The signal travels because it removes fear.

Pruning Pretty Noise
You practice the discipline of composting. A gorgeous dashboard that summarized a phase of work becomes a note in the harvest with a line explaining why it didn’t carry. A clever tagline moves to a parking lot labeled “words that don’t steer,” ready to be translated or discarded. People relax when they know pretty things aren’t sacred.

Recording Signals — Make Them Durable
You write a page titled “Signals” in the book folder. Each entry gets:
- Sentence: one Tuesday sentence (e.g., “I knew the next step without asking.”)
- Context: where it appeared (onboarding, triage, review)
- Move: what you changed to produce it
- Evidence: 1–2 examples (quotes, screenshots, count deltas)
- Habit: the pattern that keeps it alive
You link this page in the book’s index and reference it when you plan moves. This isn’t a brag wall; it’s a map of things that carry.

Q&A — Does everything need to be a signal?
No. Some necessary work sits behind the scenes. Signals matter when attention is scarce and decisions are heavy. Use them to steer; don’t fetishize them.

Q&A — What if a leader demands noise?
Give them a small, testable signal. Frame it as a probe that teaches. Show the evidence next week. If they still want noise, you have a governance problem (later chapter) not a signals problem.

Q&A — Can signals be wrong?
Yes. A thing can carry and still carry you in the wrong direction. That’s why you keep the map alive and tie signals to outcomes (“fewer dead ends,” “safer changes”), not applause.

Remote Case — A Sentence That Traveled
A remote engineer drops in a note: “Docs told me the next API to call.” The phrase starts repeating in other channels. You trace it back to a small change in the docs page: a highlighted “Next” block with the exact method and a short why. You paste a screenshot into the Signals page, write the past‑tense decision, and add a tiny habit: every new doc page must declare “Next” and “Why” at the top. The sentence keeps traveling; the habit keeps it from fading.

Leader’s Corner — Remove Friction, Don’t Add Hype
When leaders hear “signal,” some imagine a campaign. You remind them signals are the opposite of campaigns: they remove friction instead of adding messaging. They become the way people talk because they make talking unnecessary.

Signal Hygiene — Keep It Honest
- No cherry‑picking: include the quiet wins as well as the neat anecdotes.
- No overfitting: if the sentence only appears in one team’s thread, test it in another context before you enshrine it.
- No hero worship: link to habits and artifacts, not people.

Bridge to Craft — Design & Writing
Designers and writers are your best friends here. Ask them to turn signals into affordances and sentences that don’t draw attention to themselves. “Quiet generosity” is your aesthetic: the work does the social lift so the people don’t have to.

From Signal to Stewardship
You end by pointing toward stewardship: how to keep this gentle discipline from becoming jargon. “We’ll keep a live page of signals with habits and evidence,” you say. “We’ll prune what stops carrying. We’ll never confuse volume for truth.” You stop there. The bowl doesn’t ring every time. The room is already tuned.

Small Move: Run the five‑person loop on one idea this week. If three people repeat the idea back unprompted and it reduces effort for someone, add it to the Signals page with one sentence, a screenshot, and a habit to keep it alive.

Workshop Transcript (Excerpt)
Facilitator: “Tell it to five different roles. Don’t sell it; just tell it.”
Support: “It told me the next step when I hesitated.”
Designer: “I saw the next affordance before I asked.”
Engineer: “I knew it was safe to merge.”
Ops: “I didn’t need to open a second tool.”
Customer Proxy: “I didn’t have to ask where to go.”
Facilitator: “Notice the verbs?”
Room: “Knew. Saw. Didn’t have to ask.”
Facilitator: “That’s carry.”

Signal Catalog (examples)
- Next Step Hint (product): fewer hesitations; screenshot + decision record; habit: show Next + Why.
- Past‑Tense Decisions (project): one sentence at top of doc; habit: owners/clocks always included.
- Safety/Risk Notes (engineering): merge conversations shift from nits to risk; habit: notes required.
- Two‑Image Rule (communication): every abstract claim paired with two images; habit: review checks for it.
- Weekly Ledger (ops): hum named + retune chosen; habit: two rows minimum; compost what doesn’t move anything.

Noise Composting (stories)
The Campaign That Did Nothing
A beautiful campaign promised “seamless collaboration.” Engagement spiked. Support tickets about “where do I?” also spiked. The team reran signals: no Tuesday sentence to carry. They composted the campaign and shipped “Next” affordances in three places. Engagement dropped, then stayed steady. Hesitations fell. The campaign died; the work lived.

The Dashboard That Performed Progress
A dashboard with six colors made leadership meetings feel informed. No one could name a single decision it enabled. When asked for the Tuesday sentence, people said, “We felt confident.” That wasn’t a decision. They retired the dashboard and added a small “decision record” box to existing pages. Confidence rose because decisions existed, not because charts did.

Asynchronous Signals — How They Travel Without You
- Docs: a single “Next” box with a method signature and a 10‑word why.
- Issues: a past‑tense line at the top (“We shipped X because Y.”)
- Commits: imperative in subject; rationale in body; link to the decision record.
- PR templates: safety/risk notes.
- Handbooks: signals catalog page linked from onboarding; people add to it their first week.

Travel Map — Team of Teams
You draw a larger route: product marketing → sales → success → product → design → eng → ops → compliance. You pick one signal—“I knew the next step”—and ask each team to place where it dies. Sales says “handoff to success.” Success says “no read on customer intent.” Product says “PRD doesn’t include ‘Next’.” Design says “we don’t get telemetry.” Engineering says “feature flags hide affordances.” Ops says “no one posts the decision record.” Compliance says “we don’t see why a permission changed.” You don’t fix it in a meeting. You pick the smallest habit that resurrects the signal at two choke points. Often that’s a sentence; sometimes a telemetry event; rarely a new tool.

Failure Modes (and retunes)
- Mistaking applause for pull → ask for repeat rate across roles.
- Shipping a signal too big → shrink to a hint, a line, a default.
- Over‑indexing on one team’s signal → run the five‑person loop in another team; if it dies, it’s local.
- Signal drift into jargon → rewrite the sentence in Tuesday words; if you can’t, it’s noise.

Q&A (more)
- Can the same signal serve different roles? Yes. The sentence stays; the artifact changes form. The “Next” in docs becomes a “Next” in UI becomes a “Next” in triage notes.
- What if a signal offends craft? Honor craft with restraint. A quiet affordance can be beautiful; the point is relief, not spectacle.

Design Patterns — Embedding Signals
- Soft defaults that favor the right choice.
- Inline why: two words that justify feedback (“because…”)
- Proximity: put the next move next to the moment of hesitation.
- Gentle refusal: make the wrong move possible but slower and clearer.

Metrics That Matter (for this chapter)
- Repeat rate across roles (unprompted mentions of the sentence)
- Time‑to‑helpful (support), time‑to‑merge (eng), time‑to‑decision (PM)
- Hesitation heatmap (where hints reduce pauses)
- Decision records per week; percent with owners/clocks

Rehearsal Tip
Practice the five‑person loop on a harmless idea to feel the difference between push and pull. Notice your instinct to defend. Don’t. If it carries, it carries. If it doesn’t, compost gracefully.

Remote Transcript (short)
Facilitator: “Tell it in one sentence in Tuesday words.”
Designer: “When someone blanks, the UI shows the next step.”
Engineer: “I can make that event cheap.”
Support: “If it shows, we’ll see fewer ‘where do I…’s.”
Ops: “Then we’ll log a decision record; past tense.”
Leader: “No deck?”
Room: (laughter)
Facilitator: “No deck.”

The Point
Signals are how a system says yes to itself. Noise is how a system asks you to clap so it can ignore what hurts. You don’t shame the noise; you compost it. You don’t worship signals; you use them to place the next small move where it will carry.

Signals vs KPIs — Don’t Confuse Means and Ends
KPIs are dials. Signals are the quiet clicks that move the dials without you standing there turning them. A KPI says “time‑to‑helpful dropped”; a signal says “I didn’t have to ask.” You keep both, but you trust signals first because they are lived. When KPIs drift from signals, signals win. The survivor is the sentence a person would say.

Case — Onboarding in One Breath
Before: new hires asked “Which doc is current?” every third day. After: the “Start Here” page gained a two‑line “Next” with a date and an owner. The question frequency dropped; a phrase appeared: “I knew where to start.” KPI improved, but you didn’t chase it. You chased the sentence.

Leader Move — Step Out to Hear Carry
You leave the room after shipping a small signal and watch what happens without your presence. Does the phrase appear in channels you don’t moderate? Do teams you didn’t brief ask for the affordance? If you have to go back in to argue, it was noise or not ready; if it moves, write the decision in past tense and step away again.

Common Signals (across domains)
- Product: Next + Why blocks; safe defaults; progressive disclosure that reduces dead ends.
- Engineering: safety/risk notes; visible rollback; small PRs; clear change impact; fewer “how do I run it?”s.
- Support: first‑reply scripts that teach customers; triage suggestions with why; fewer escalations for basics.
- Ops: single visible clock; owners named; decision records replace weekly “syncs.”
- Design: affordances that look like what they do; fewer explanatory tooltips because you don’t need them.
- Docs: top‑of‑page “Next” + “Why”; examples first; fewer “where do I find…?”s.

Email Templates — Ask for Observations
Subject: Quick signal check — one sentence

Hi <Name>,
We’re testing a small move: <Tuesday sentence>. In your work this week, did you notice any moment where you didn’t have to ask / knew the next step / avoided a dead end? One line or screenshot is perfect.
Thanks,
<You>

Subject: Where did this die?

Hi <Name>,
We think “<sentence>” should travel to your team. Where did it stop? A line or example helps. We’ll adjust the habit, not pile on.
Thanks,
<You>

Case — Removing a Noisy Feature
A team loved a “Welcome Carousel” that showed five slides with slogans. Support kept getting “Where do I start?” You ran a probe: remove the carousel for 50% and add one “Start Here” button with a next action. Two weeks later, the sentence “I knew where to start” appeared in two unrelated channels. The carousel went to compost; no one missed it except the person who built it, and even they admitted their relief.

Slack Hygiene — Reduce Broadcast Noise
- Ban recap posts that lack owners/clocks. Replace with decision records.
- Encourage “past tense, with why” for any change announcement.
- Move applause to a #wins channel and keep work channels clear. Applause isn’t evil; it’s just loud.

From Signals to Boundaries
Signals show you where your edges should be. The “Next” block reveals that onboarding and docs own a seam; draw a boundary so no one fights in the fog. The safety note reveals that certain changes need a slower clock; write that into a boundary so no one argues with a spreadsheet later.

Workshop — Signal Hunt (30 minutes)
1) Collect 10 phrases from the last two weeks that sound like ease (“I knew…”, “I didn’t…”).
2) Cluster by role and context.
3) Pick two clusters; identify the smallest move that created them.
4) Write a sentence, a screenshot, a habit for each. Add to the Signals page.
5) Prune one noisy thing that competes with each signal.

Signal Drift — Keep Them Clean
Signals calcify into slogans if you stop tending them. Put a clock on each entry: when will we re‑confirm this still carries? If the phrase stops appearing, ask what changed. Don’t defend the old move; compost it and write the next one.

Leader’s Anti‑Pattern — The Hero Narrative
When signals appear, some leaders turn them into a story about vision. You redirect the credit to the habit: “This worked because we wrote a ‘Next’ line and a past‑tense decision, not because we all believe.” The team stays grounded; the habit survives the leader’s vacation.

Case — Integrations: A Partner’s Signal
Partners keep complaining about “ecosystem.” You translate it into “the three partners that reduce tickets the most.” You add a “Next” in the partner docs and a “Why” that names a concrete permission. The sentence “we knew what to do with partner X” appears in support and in a partner’s email. You don’t celebrate; you screenshot and add to Signals.

Cross‑Chapter Bridge — Edges and Maps
You’ll use these signals to draw better maps in The Resonance Map and to set edges in Boundaries and Edges. Keep the sentences handy; they become labels on the map and tests at the edges.

Practice Prompts
- Write down the last sentence you heard that sounded like ease. What small move made it possible?
- Name one pretty noise you saw this week. Where will you compost it?
- Ask someone outside your team to repeat back your idea in their words. Did it carry?

Reassurance — Quiet Wins Are Real
You won’t get a parade for removing a hesitation. You’ll get a calmer line in a graph and fewer pings at 5 p.m. That’s the kind of progress that builds a culture you can live in. The measure is breath, not applause.

Metrics Bridge — Into the Rhythm Ledger
Carry three counters forward:
- Sentences of ease per week (unprompted, across roles)
- Decision records added (past tense, with why, owners/clocks)
- Hints/affordances that reduce hesitation (before/after)
Plot them lightly in the Rhythm Ledger. You’re not seeking a perfect curve; you’re watching whether the field is learning to carry itself.

Dev/Line/Copy Notes (for this chapter)
- Dev: check that each section ends with a small forward pressure (a move, a habit, a test).
- Line: keep “signal” sentences concrete and avoid romance; one longer reflective line per major section is enough.
- Copy: normalize capitalization (“Next” block), hyphenation (past‑tense, time‑to‑helpful), and em‑dash spacing.

Remote Tooling — Signals Wall (lightweight)
Create a page titled “Signals Wall” that only accepts entries in the template: Sentence / Context / Move / Evidence / Habit. No pitches, no threads. People paste screenshots and one‑liners. Review weekly for patterns. Prune entries that stop carrying.

Additional Q&A
- What if people spoof signals to get their work prioritized? Ask for evidence and habit. If they only have a sentence, it’s an opinion. If they have a sentence, a screenshot, and a habit, it’s probably carry.
- How do we avoid only shipping small hints? Hints are a wedge. When a hint carries, it unlocks a bigger move with less risk. Use the map to sequence.
- Can a metric be a signal? Rarely. A metric can hint at a signal if paired with a sentence of ease and an artifact that caused it.

Linker — Toward Boundaries and Edges
“Now that you know what carries, you can protect it. Boundaries are where signals survive the meeting and live in the system.”

Mini Case — Sales Deck vs Narrative Doc
The sales deck said “unified platform.” Prospects nodded and stalled. A three‑paragraph narrative doc replaced it. First paragraph: Tuesday promise (“I set up a workflow without asking for help”). Second: a screenshot with a “Next” arrow. Third: a short why with constraints named. Demos got shorter, conversations got clearer, close rate improved modestly, customer success thanked sales for not selling haze. No one missed the deck; everyone copied the narrative.

Practice — 20‑Minute Signal Sprint
Set a timer for 20 minutes with your team.
1) Collect three sentences of ease from the past week.
2) For one, write the move and the habit that sustain it.
3) For one, identify the choke point on the travel map and choose a small move to keep it alive.
4) For one, write the compost note for the noise it replaces.
Stop. Paste each result into the Signals page. Repeat next week.

Coda — Quiet Authority
Signals give you a kind of authority that doesn’t need volume. You point to a sentence and a screenshot and a habit and say, “This is what we do.” You can do that without being in charge of anyone. The system starts to align because alignment feels like less work, not because you convinced anyone. That’s stewardship’s tone.
It is the sound of work that carries itself, quietly.
