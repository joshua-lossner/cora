# Inspiration
Final key‑lift; motif resolves brighter. Add a [Vocal Breakdown] (stacked harmonies, minimal kit) before the final choruses; long outro to breathe.

# Notes (optional)
Keep the last chorus wide and generous; let the outro run 10–16s with ad‑libs.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band finale at 120 BPM. Bright polysynth, clean guitar sparkle, pop kit, side‑chained sub‑bass, big harmony stacks. [Vocal Breakdown] before final choruses; key‑lift feel; long outro with ad‑libs. No heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Bright poly + guitar sparkle]

[Verse 1]
Morning threads through doors and hands,
Patterns we can understand.
We stitch our days with simple care—
A promise woven in the air.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Every small step ties the line,
Pull together, watch it shine.

[Chorus]
Thread us in (thread us in),
Tie our hearts to the same wind.
Hold the tone and let it spin—
Thread us in, thread us in.

[Verse 2]
Neighbors’ names and open gates,
Shared songs at different rates.
We don’t have to sing the same,
Just keep time and say the name.

[Vocal Breakdown]
[Minimal kit; stacked “ooh/ahh” chords on 1–♭3–4]

[Bridge]
All our voices make the field,
We get louder when we yield.

[Chorus]
Thread us in (thread us in),
Tie our hearts to the same wind.
Hold the tone and let it spin—
Thread us in, thread us in.

[Chorus]
Thread us in (thread us in),
Tie our hearts to the same wind.
Hold the tone and let it spin—
Thread us in, thread us in.

[Post‑Chorus]
Da‑da (1–♭3–4), thread us in.

[Outro]
[Long fade with ad‑libs]
