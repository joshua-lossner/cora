# Inspiration

Community as music you can see: street‑corner crowd, handclaps, neighbors joining in. The sax takes a joyous lap, then a double‑chorus with everyone singing the hook.

# Style Prompt

Uptempo 1950s rock & roll (~158 BPM) with handclaps, boogie‑woogie piano, clean twang guitar, upright bass slap, and exuberant tenor sax. Rowdy lead with stacked gang vocals in English; add a celebratory [Sax Solo] and finish with a double [Chorus] and gentle fade. Mono‑ish mix; exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Crowd “hey!” and claps; band hits]

[Verse 1]
Newsstand chatter and the lights all blink,
Somebody starts a beat on the corner sink,
Neighbors trade smiles and a soda‑pop wink,
Next thing you know there’s a band in the pink.

[Chorus]
Corner jamboree — sing it loud!
Corner jamboree — gather the crowd!
Every little voice makes the street feel free,
Corner, corner, corner jamboree!

[Verse 2]
Grandma hums harmony, kids go wild,
Steel toes shuffle and the rhythm’s styled,
Sax jumps in with a sunny smile,
This is our town for a little while.

[Sax Solo]
[Joyful chorus quotes]

[Chorus]
Corner jamboree — sing it loud!
Corner jamboree — gather the crowd!

[Chorus]
Corner jamboree — sing it loud!
Corner jamboree — gather the crowd!

[Outro]
[Handclaps continue under a soft fade]
