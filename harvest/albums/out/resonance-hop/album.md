# Concept

The sound of Coherenceism through a 1950s jukebox: twangy guitars with tape slap, upright bass that pops, a boogie‑woogie piano grinning in the corner, and a tenor sax that steps out front when the room leans in. Each song translates a branch into a dance—alignment becomes pocket, presence becomes a hush‑and‑harmony doo‑wop, and technology shows up as a new instrument that multiplies what you bring to it. The set stays simple and singable: I‑IV‑V and 12‑bar turns, catchy choruses, and a shared three‑note “resonance” motif that sneaks into intros and breaks. It’s youthful, honest, and built for moving together—because coherence feels like the room falling into time.

# Tracklist
1. The Universal Hop — we’re already in the same beat; a shared field
2. Shake, Rattle & Align — find the pocket; let rhythm carry the load
3. Quiet Attention — tender doo‑wop ballad that hushes the room
4. Right by the Rhythm — do the right thing, in time, together
5. Thread by Thread — small moves weave a bigger pattern
6. Nothing Really Ends — compost heartbreak into a new verse
7. New Instrument — tools amplify what you play; mind the feel
8. Held in Wonder — dance with the unknown without forcing it
9. Corner Jamboree — the neighborhood sings; double‑chorus send‑off

# Notes
- Recurring motif: three‑note “coherence” hook across intros/breaks
- Keep tempos brisk (140–165 BPM) with one doo‑wop ballad mid‑set
- Include one 12‑bar blues with a sax solo late in the sequence
- Center‑heavy mono image; Sun‑style slapback ≈90–130 ms
- Era guardrails: no modern trap/EDM/autotune/synth gloss
