# Outline — City of Quiet Signals

## Acts / Parts
1) Setup — Mara learns the quiet network exists; small cost for listening
2) Pressure — Signals scramble as a data‑poacher hunts; trust frays
3) Decision — A failed capture reveals the true channel; small move wins

## Chapters
1. Noise Map — Reading the city’s interference; the first quiet signal
   - Beat 1: Mara maps train noise patterns during her commute
   - Beat 2: A stranger (Jae) points to a blank corridor on her paper map
   - Beat 3: The archive’s stacks “hum” differently when the power cycles
   - Beat 4: She notices a deliberate pause in announcements: a gap
   - Beat 5: Jae leaves a coaster rotated 45°; she chooses to notice
   - Exit: She copies the blank corridor onto a clean card

2. The Quiet Signal — Learning a tiny language
   - Beat 1: Jae shows micro‑gesture syntax at a cafe table
   - Beat 2: A transit guard’s routine shifts; they go silent
   - Beat 3: Mara practices by mirroring strangers’ breath pace
   - Beat 4: A wrong interpretation nearly exposes them
   - Beat 5: She writes a one‑line rule: interpret twice, act once
   - Exit: She signals back—barely

3. Archive of Breath — Proof the library listens
   - Beat 1: Night in the stacks; HVAC down; breath fogs
   - Beat 2: Boxes labeled “misc” carry consistent edges; hidden order
   - Beat 3: She finds a reel with someone cataloging pauses
   - Beat 4: Vessa (data‑poacher) surfaces as a rumor in old memos
   - Beat 5: Mara learns the archive’s safe hours
   - Exit: She pockets a carbon copy with a frequency table

4. The Listening Room — Pressure increases
   - Beat 1: Jae takes her to a room tuned for silence
   - Beat 2: They test the city’s “gaps” timing window
   - Beat 3: Vessa’s probe hits a friend’s home network
   - Beat 4: A quiet signal fails; wrong stakes
   - Beat 5: They alter the pattern—small move, new cost
   - Exit: A phone vibrates once on a dead table

5. False Flags — When noise looks like a signal
   - Beat 1: Vessa seeds decoys; network panics
   - Beat 2: Mara builds a check: breath‑paced double confirmation
   - Beat 3: A decoy pulls Jae into a trap; she holds
   - Beat 4: The archive buries them under alarms
   - Beat 5: She walks the stack by touch; finds the cool seam
   - Exit: She refuses the “urgent” pull; the trap misses

6. The Drift — Losing the thread
   - Beat 1: Sleep debt and doubt; misreads multiply
   - Beat 2: Jae vanishes; rumors say turned
   - Beat 3: The city floods with concerts and fireworks (masking)
   - Beat 4: She sits on the train and does nothing, on purpose
   - Beat 5: The map’s blank corridor extends
   - Exit: She gives up a big move; chooses a smaller one

7. Open Channel — The true pattern
   - Beat 1: The archive’s power cycles sync with transit windows
   - Beat 2: She replays the reel: the pauses are addresses
   - Beat 3: Vessa’s trace expects talk, not silence
   - Beat 4: She aligns breath with the cycle and opens a channel
   - Beat 5: A single LED blink answers from the stacks
   - Exit: She schedules a meeting with no time listed

8. The Small Move — Resolution
   - Beat 1: Vessa arrives loud; the room does nothing
   - Beat 2: Mara adjusts one knob by a hair; power dips
   - Beat 3: The signal traverses the gap; the city listens
   - Beat 4: Jae returns; not turned—quiet
   - Beat 5: They seed three new blanks into the public map
   - Exit: The city keeps breathing; small moves continue
