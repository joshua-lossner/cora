# Why Presence Beats Productivity

We keep trying to outrun noise with speed. It doesn’t work. Presence reduces noise at the source, turning the same minute into a different minute.

## The Real Constraint
Time isn’t your bottleneck; attention is. Productivity hacks rearrange tasks. Presence changes the quality of attention applied to any task.

## Practice Link
Start with the practice: [The One-Breath Reset](/leaf/one-breath-reset). One slow breath before each context switch. Notice the field change.

## Pattern Link
When deadlines compress, trade breadth for depth: fewer commitments, fully attended. The resulting clarity removes rework and restores momentum.

## Try This Today
- Choose one conversation to give undivided attention.
- Close surplus tabs before starting the next block.
- Take one breath before you press send.

Presence isn’t slower; it’s cleaner. Clean beats fast in the long run.
