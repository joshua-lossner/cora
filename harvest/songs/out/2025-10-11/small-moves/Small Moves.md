# Inspiration

Closer/anthem. Daily practice, steady rhythm; small moves add up. Hook repeats a crisp line twice at the end; leave a short instrumental tail for the fade.

# Style Prompt

’90s boom‑bap at 92 BPM; confident, grounded mood; Rhodes/piano stabs on chopped loop; punchy kick+snare; repeatable maxim hook with double chorus finale. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Double Chorus → Outro. Vocals: gritty, motivational but concrete; no platitudes. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy risers, heavy autotune; vocal‑forward, dynamic master.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Rhodes stab; handclap pickup]

[Verse 1]
People want the mountain; I just lace another shoe,
Stack the reps in quiet rooms till something sturdy follows through.
Every “later” is a liar; now’s the only honest clock,
So I put a line of bricks where I can reach and let it lock.
I don’t chase a magic method; I return to breath and pen,
Count my blessings like a tempo — one, and two, and start again.
When the thunder fades to weather, you can hear the steady rain —
That’s the rhythm change your life with, not the fireworks in pain.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Verse 2]
I’ve been loud and I’ve been noble; only one of those will build,
Nobility is repetition; loud is sugar when you’re ill.
So I take my medicine in actions I can stand,
If it fits into a minute, it can spread across the land.
Check the boxes that you made, not the ones that make you numb,
Put the finish line in inches so your courage learns to come.
Every chorus is a contract, not a slogan for a crowd —
If I sing it, I must do it when the music isn’t loud.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Verse 3]
When I miss, I make it tiny — pick a single next right step,
No performative repentance; just respect for what is kept.
If I brag, I brag in doing: swept the floor, returned the call,
Wrote the verse, paid the favor — little debts that free us all.
Some will laugh at what looks trivial; I don’t owe them any show,
We are building future cities out of minutes that we own.
When the chorus comes, it doubles like a promise made to two —
Me and me‑tomorrow shaking hands on what we’ll do.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Chorus]
Small moves — every day, same groove,
Small moves — let the work make proof.
Small moves — keep it plain, keep true,
Small moves — watch the ground turn new.

[Outro]
[Instrumental tail; scratches echo “small… moves”]
