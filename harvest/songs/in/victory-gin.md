# Inspiration

The room spins slowly through gin-clouded vision. Sounds blur and muffle. The telescreen's voice becomes distant static. Time loses meaning in the haze. This is the numbed interval between broken and compliant, the drugged drift before total surrender. Low synth drones envelop everything. The surveillance ping, if present at all, is buried deep in the fog—no longer threatening because there's nothing left to threaten.

# Notes (optional)

- Pure ambient interlude, minimal structure
- Focus on thick, hazy textures—everything muffled and distant
- Should feel like dissociation, alcohol-induced numbness
- No clear rhythm or melody—just drift
- Transition smoothly from previous track's defeat into this drugged state
- Sets up the final track's hollow acceptance
