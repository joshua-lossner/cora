# Inspiration

Closer as quiet craft—mending nets, tying small knots, a community weaving its days. The chorus repeats like hands at work: “Thread by thread.” End with an extended dub outro, bass and heartbeat fade.

# Notes (optional)

Variation: replace final [Chorus, Outro] with a long [Dub Outro]. Keep delays musical and sparse.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 76 BPM; steady one‑drop, warm bass, organ bubble. Keep verses intimate; mantra‑like hook. Add concise [Instrumental Break] and close with an extended [Outro] featuring dub‑style echoes over bass and horn tags; keep delays musical and sparse.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Upstroke guitar and soft rim click]

[Verse 1]
Tie the line and mend the net,
Hold the tension, don’t forget.
Little knots that keep it true—
This is how we make it through.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread,
We keep the fabric fed.
Thread by thread—
Color into bread.

[Verse 2]
Pass a story, pass a meal,
Share a kindness you can feel.
Day by day and hand to hand—
Weave a stronger, softer land.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread,
We keep the fabric fed.

[Instrumental Break]
[Bass and organ tumble; echo horn tag]

[Chorus]
Thread by thread—
Color into bread.

[Dub Outro]
[Long echo tails over bass heartbeat]
