# Field Extraction — Rest-Rhythm — 2025-10-25

## Seed 1: The Five‑Minute Reset Outperforms the Twelve‑Hour Push

### Pattern
Short, deliberate resets restore signal faster than long, strained sprints. Micro‑rests rebalance attention, improving throughput and decision quality without changing total hours.

### Tension
Why do teams keep choosing long pushes that erode clarity when brief resets yield better outcomes the same day?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Presence as Foundation — Attention precedes effective action; a reset reintroduces presence.
- Secondary: Alignment over Force — Position the system (you) so reality carries the work; stop pushing through noise.

### Evidence
- Deep Sheep (cave rescue) (MetaFilter)
- One-Breath Reset (coherenceism/leaves/one-breath-reset.md)
- Alignment Check (coherenceism/leaves/alignment-check.md)

### River Fit
Directly changes daily pacing: choose micro‑resets over extended strain.

## Seed 2: Seasons, Not Schedules

### Pattern
Work rhythms flatten natural cycles. Planning in seasons (build, tend, harvest, compost) reduces burnout by matching energy to phase.

### Tension
What if quarterly targets conflict with the phase the work is actually in?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Compost Cycles — Endings and rests feed the next phase.
- Secondary: Living Traditions — Let forms adapt while patterns persist.

### Evidence
- Alignment Check (coherenceism/leaves/alignment-check.md)

### River Fit
Shifts today’s plan: identify phase and right‑size effort accordingly.

## Seed 3: Input Hygiene Is Energy Management

### Pattern
High‑noise inputs (feeds, alerts) consume the same attentional energy as deep work. Tightening inputs restores capacity without adding time.

### Tension
How much clarity would return if we narrowed inputs for one day?

### Coherenceism Lens
- Primary: Field Stewardship — Inputs shape the field you act within.
- Secondary: Presence as Foundation — Attention returns when noise drops.

### Evidence
- One-Breath Reset (coherenceism/leaves/one-breath-reset.md)

### River Fit
Immediate change to pacing: reduce inputs before attempting output.
