## Entries

### 2025-10-25T00:15:00+0000 — workflow — rest-rhythm field observation and blog post

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/2025-10/rest-rhythm-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/2025-10/rest-rhythm-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-25-the-five-minute-reset-beats-the-twelve-hour-push.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-rest-rhythm.md
- Summary: Ran rest-rhythm workflow offline using internal leaves and a cultural signal; extracted three seeds and published one post on micro-resets as daily pacing.
- Outcome: One published post; all five rivers now validated across workflow.
- Follow-ups: Re-run scans with live feeds when network access is available; consider a short “input hygiene” post from Seed 3.

### 2025-10-25T00:00:00+0000 — workflow — history-systems field observation and blog post

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [harvest/blog-posts/scans/2025-10/history-systems-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/extractions/2025-10/history-systems-2025-10-25.md, harvest/blog-posts/out/2025-10-25-when-counting-replaces-witnessing-legitimacy-thins-out.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: workflows/writing/field-observation-history-systems.md
- Summary: Ran history-systems workflow offline using recent in-repo sources; created scan and extraction, drafted and published one post applying Field Stewardship and Nested Coherence to measurement vs. presence.
- Outcome: One published post; history-systems river validated. Rest-rhythm remains to test next.
- Follow-ups: Run rest-rhythm workflow; revisit richer evidence when network access is available.

### 2025-10-25T16:38:00+0000 — context-add — add cellar/ for private content and consolidate personal workspace

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [cellar/, cellar/COHERENCE.md, cellar/.gitkeep, cellar/personal/, cellar/household/, cellar/learning/, cellar/professional/, cellar/projects/, cellar/tasks/, cellar/logs/, cellar/workflows/, workflows/learning/, .gitignore, context/projects/cora.md, workflows/COHERENCE.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: manual migration
- Summary: Added cellar/ directory as private workspace for personal content, projects, and daily practice. Migrated content from ~/Projects/joshua.lossner into cellar/. Moved public learning workflows to workflows/learning/. Updated .gitignore to check in structure (COHERENCE.md, TEMPLATE.md) but ignore all content. Philosophy: CORA is architecture for coherent human-AI collaboration, not just content publishing.
- Outcome: Personal workspace consolidated under one CORA tree. Public/private boundary clarified (harvest/ vs cellar/). Templates and structure documented.
- Follow-ups: Test cellar workflows in daily practice; consolidate presentation layers into one site; retire ~/Projects/joshua.lossner after validation
