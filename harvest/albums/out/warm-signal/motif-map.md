# Resonance Motif Map

Motif: a quiet three‑note cell (e.g., 1–♭3–4 feel; adapt to key) that recurs as tag, harmony hint, or countermelody. Use sparingly; let it feel discovered, not announced.

- Wide Open Mind — organ tag on [Outro]; light guitar echo in [Chorus]
- Passing Through — Rhodes echo under [Chorus]; soft BGV hum on last line
- Lean with the Line — guitar tag on [Outro]; tambourine accents mirror rhythm
- Stay with the Note — BGV hum in [Bridge]; single held organ note in [Outro]
- Do the Next True Thing — subtle Wurli figure between [Pre‑Chorus] and [Chorus]
- Neighbor Light — call‑and‑response BGVs hint the motif in [Chorus]
- Teach the Wire to Sing — strings outline motif in [Bridge]
- Deep Quiet Wonder — guitar harmonics hint motif in [Intro]; BGV sustain in [Chorus]
- The Living Line — choir tag restates motif on the final [Chorus] cadence

Notes
- Keep dynamics gentle; motif should feel like recognition.
- Where keys shift (e.g., small bridge lift), adapt interval shape to preserve feel.
