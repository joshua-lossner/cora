# Inspiration

A forbidden thought flickers in the grey. Winston's pen hesitates over the diary's blank page—"Down with Big Brother"—the words themselves a death sentence. The mechanical rhythm gains urgency, drum machines stutter and glitch. Synths rise with paranoid tension. The surveillance ping grows more insistent. Vocals shift from monotone to whispered intensity as consciousness awakens to its own imprisonment.

# Style Prompt

Industrial post-punk at 95 BPM with rising tension; cold analog synths building paranoia, heavy grinding bass, mechanical drum machines that stutter and glitch with increasing urgency, static textures, dissonant strings. Male baritone transitioning from weary to intense whisper; internal struggle emerging. Surveillance "ping" motif appears more frequently. Include distorted "Big Brother" backing vocals (ominous). No uplifting progressions, warm reverb, or polished delivery.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Stuttering drum machines; surveillance ping intensifies]

[Verse 1]
The pen hovers, ink won't dry,
A blank page holds a capital crime.
One thought flickering in the grey—
Down with Big Brother, dare I write the line?

[Chorus]
Forbidden words, forbidden mind,
The telescreen reads between the lines.
One wrong thought, and I'm erased—
But consciousness won't stay confined.

[Verse 2]
The diary's hidden behind the wall,
Every heartbeat's monitored sound.
Memory's crime, the past is gone—
But something in me won't back down.

[Bridge]
[Distorted backing vocals: "Big Brother... Big Brother..."]
They own the present, they own the past,
But this thought is mine, this thought will last.

[Chorus]
Forbidden words, forbidden mind,
The telescreen reads between the lines.
One wrong thought, and I'm erased—
But consciousness won't stay confined.

[Outro]
[Drum machines glitch and stutter to silence; surveillance ping echoes]
