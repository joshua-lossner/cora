# Concept
A late‑night, unhurried suite where each piece reflects a branch of Coherenceism. The palette stays warm and breathable—Rhodes and upright bass beneath brushed drums; tenor sax, flugelhorn, and clean guitar share the melody. A three‑note “resonance motif” appears across the album, introduced gently in Track 1, reharmonized mid‑sequence, and resolved in the closer. Tempos stay relaxed (70–95 BPM); the playing favors tone, silence, and conversation over virtuosity. The arc moves from wide‑field awareness toward intimate practice—nothing forced, everything placed.

# Tracklist
1. The Universal Mind — seeing the web we’re already in
2. Nothing Really Ends — compost cycles at every scale
3. Carried by the Current — positioning so reality carries you
4. Quiet Attention — alert, quiet attention
5. Gentle Resolve — choices that strengthen the field
6. Rituals We Share — rituals that keep a group alive
7. New Instrument — new instruments in the mind
8. Held in Wonder — precision and wonder held together
9. Thread by Thread — small daily threads that endure

# Notes
- Keep transients soft; no harsh cymbal wash.  
- Bass slightly forward for warmth; drums tucked with brushes.  
- Reuse the three‑note resonance motif in heads and as a tag.  
- Feature order varies for texture; overall feel remains calm and cohesive.
