# Inspiration
Synth hook states the 1–♭3–4 motif; verses trace city lights; chorus widens with stacked harmonies. Post‑chorus tag repeats the motif as a syllabic hook.

# Notes (optional)
Keep drums crisp and optimistic; let the post‑chorus breathe with pads and vocal stacks.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band pop with ’80s roots at 112 BPM. Slick claps/snaps + 808 thump with tasteful hats, lush polysynth pads, shimmer guitars, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked harmonies. Synth hook states a 1–♭3–4 motif; wide chorus; airy post‑chorus tag. No heavy EDM drops or harsh distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Synth hook states 1–♭3–4; claps enter]

[Verse 1]
Windows making constellations on the avenue,
Traffic writes a rhythm we can listen to.
Every little signal says we’re not alone,
Feel it in your chest like a dial‑tone.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Lean in, let the skyline breathe,
Under the noise there’s a melody.

[Chorus]
All around us (all around us),
We’re already in the same song.
If you hear it, you can find us—
All around us, singing along.

[Verse 2]
Billboards flicker, rain turns streets to silver lines,
Someone hums the hook and then it realigns.
You and I are parts of one long refrain,
Carried by a signal through the city rain.

[Bridge]
[Drop to pads and claps; vocal stack builds]
Take a breath, tune your heart to the room,
Every voice makes a bigger bloom.

[Chorus]
All around us (all around us),
We’re already in the same song.
If you hear it, you can find us—
All around us, singing along.

[Post‑Chorus]
Da‑da, da‑da (1–♭3–4),
Da‑da, da‑da, we’re all around.

[Outro]
[Hook repeats softly; pads fade]
