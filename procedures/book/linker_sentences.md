# Procedure — Linker Sentences (Handoffs)

Purpose
- Keep momentum between chapters with minimal glue. Avoid summaries; carry a thread, echo an image, or answer a question.

Inputs
- previous chapter’s exit hook and active threads
- next chapter’s purpose and beats

Patterns (choose one)
- Echo → Turn: repeat one image/phrase, then pivot to the new task.
- Result → Ritual: name a small outcome, then codify the habit that preserves it.
- Question → Method: surface an unresolved question, then answer with a concrete step.

Checklist (1–2 sentences max)
- Name one live thread (image, promise, or decision).
- State the new chapter’s move in plain words.
- Keep POV/tense consistent with voice guide.
- No recap paragraphs; no throat-clearing.

Examples (from this book)
- Ch1→Ch2: “You shipped a sliver on Friday. On Monday, the hum returns—so you name it before it names you.”
- Ch2→Ch3: “Now that the hum has a name, you can hear which tones carry and which are just loud.”

Expected
- 1–2 sentence linker at the top (or end) of the chapter; threads and open loops ledger updated.
