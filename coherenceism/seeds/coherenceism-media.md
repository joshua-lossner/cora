# Seed — Coherenceism.media

Build a quiet, coherent media surface: audio essays (narrated leaves), reflective conversations, and occasional video — minimal production, maximum clarity.

## Germination Notes
- Format: 10–20 minute audio essays; 30–45 minute conversations.
- Cadence: monthly to start; prioritize signal over frequency.
- Distribution: open RSS feed; embedded on `coherenceism.info`; clips cross‑posted to `.net` where appropriate.

## MVP Slice
- 2 narrated leaves (audio essays) + 1 conversation on a current issue.
- Episode notes link directly to CORA sources (leaf/seed/context paths) and claim tables if present.
- Simple landing page with feed and episode index.

## Rails
- CORA is canonical for scripts/notes; media repos handle hosting/distribution.
- Provenance footer for each episode: sources, authorship, updated.

## Guardrails
- No outrage bait; avoid hot takes. Clarity over virality.
- Respect privacy and consent for guests and quoted material.

## Success Signals
- Listeners can move from an episode to its CORA sources in one click.
- Episodes remain useful beyond the news cycle (evergreen clarity).

## Next Steps (Downstream)
1) Initialize `coherenceism.media` repo; set up RSS and hosting.
2) Record and publish first audio essay; add notes linking to CORA.
3) Produce one conversation episode with a clear, coherent brief.
