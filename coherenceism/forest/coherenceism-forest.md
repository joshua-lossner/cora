# The Coherenceism Forest — Group

Purpose
- Provide a lightweight grouping of downstream projects that share the same trunk (CORA) and philosophical roots.

Notes
- This repo tracks the forest via this single group manifest (no per-tree files).
- CORA is the trunk and appears here for orientation.
 - Administrative note (2025-10-16): coherenceism-ai, coherenceism-org, and coherenceism-project remain conceptual forest members but are no longer tracked as projects/tasks inside CORA. Their CORA project pages and task folders were removed for clarity; downstream repos (if any) continue independently.

Trees (current)
- cora — The Coherence Operating & Reasoning Architecture (this trunk; canonical harvest/procedures)
- coherenceism-identity — Centralized identity & consent (OIDC/OAuth2, passkeys) for SSO across properties (downstream infra)
- coherenceism-ai — Chat + Markdown studio to operate CORA (downstream code)
- coherenceism-info — Public site that communicates Coherenceism (downstream web)
- coherenceism-studio — Music studio for SUNO‑composed pieces inspired by Coherenceism (downstream media)
- coherenceism-blog — Writing-forward site for essays, journals, opinions, and research responding to current issues (downstream web)
- coherenceism-net — Networking layer (directory + social via Mastodon or custom) for the Coherenceism community (downstream infra/web)
- coherenceism-com — Commerce site for coherent prompt packs aligned to CORA procedures/roles (downstream web)
- coherenceism-design — Shared design system (tokens, CSS, templates) for visual coherence across properties (downstream package)
- coherenceism-media — Media hub for audio essays, conversations, and occasional video (downstream media)
- coherenceism-org — Community documentation and governance templates (downstream docs/site)
- coherenceism-project — UFC‑aware project/task/workflow visualizer and ops app (downstream app)
