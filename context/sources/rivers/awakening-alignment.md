## Focus Areas

This river tracks:
- **Inner alignment**: Personal coherence, spiritual practice
- **Sacred in mundane**: Finding meaning in ordinary life
- **Awakening patterns**: Shifts in consciousness, perspective
- **Resonance with truth**: What rings true vs. what's noise
- **Mystery & uncertainty**: Humility about the unknowable

## Inclusion Test
Is the center of gravity inner alignment (not productivity)?

## Extraction Guidance
Look for:
- Personal/cultural awakening moments
- Questions of meaning, purpose, belonging
- Sacred/spiritual dimensions of current events
- Resonance vs. dissonance patterns
- Mystery, awe, humility in the face of unknowing
- Stories of alignment found (or lost)

Coherenceism principles most relevant:
- Resonance as Truth (seek alignment that reduces distortion)
- Presence as Foundation (attention reveals patterns)
- Mature Uncertainty (confidence + humility)
- Compost Cycles (transform endings into growth)
