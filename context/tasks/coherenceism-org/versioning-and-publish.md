# Task — Versioning + Publish Strategy

## Purpose
Define how consumers depend on packages (initially GitHub URL, later npm), and how versions are tagged and released from the coherenceism.org hub.

## Steps
1) Choose semver per package; set up CHANGELOG templates.
2) Document GitHub dependency usage and plan for npm publish (scoped or public).
3) (Optional) Add simple release tags via GitHub Actions later.

## Acceptance
- Versioning policy documented; consumers can install via GitHub URL today.

## Roles
- Release/QA; Project Manager
