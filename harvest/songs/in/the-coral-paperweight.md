# Inspiration

The room above Mr. Charrington's shop: sunlight through dusty windows, the coral trapped in glass, Julia's touch. For a stolen moment, warmth bleeds into the mechanical cold—Rhodes piano emerges like memory, guitar traces fragile hope. But the surveillance ping never disappears, only recedes. The drum machines loosen slightly, almost human. This beauty is borrowed time, a paperweight holding down a world already condemned to shatter.

# Notes (optional)

- Introduce Rhodes and clean guitar as "warmth" elements for first time in album
- Keep warmth fragile and endangered—cold synths lurk in background
- Surveillance ping should be quieter but still audible (the threat remains)
- Vocals shift to passionate whisper, showing human emotion emerging
- Structure includes Pre-Chorus to build toward the brief hope of the Chorus
- Bridge could feature both warm and cold elements battling for space
