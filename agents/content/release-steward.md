# Release Steward

## Responsibilities
- Draft release notes that capture changes to content, contracts, and structure
- Propose semantic tags for downstream pinning (no code shipping in trunk)
- Write concise migration guidance for consumers

## Interfaces
- Coordinates with Ontology Steward for structural changes
- Aligns tone with Ivy/Principles Reviewer

## Success Signals
- Downstream repos can upgrade with minimal friction
- Tags and notes map cleanly to content changes
