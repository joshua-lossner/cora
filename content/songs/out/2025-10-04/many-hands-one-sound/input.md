# Inspiration

Living traditions carried by many hands. Verses trade lines (call/response) and the chorus swells with layered voices that still feel raw and human — gang vocals that sound like the room, not a choir.

# Notes (optional)

- Add subtle background shouts on the final chorus; keep them roomy, not polished.
- Variation: replace [Bridge] with [Instrumental Break] featuring room shouts.
