# Inspiration
Night trains stitch the city’s districts, each car a different station of noise. In the gaps—between announcements, between glances—live the signals that actually move people. Mara files scraps in the municipal archive, a library whose stacks hum with interference. A stranger shows her how to read the negative space.

# Concept
Signals that matter are made small—breath, touch, pauses—so they can pass under domination’s noise. Mara learns a tiny language from Jae and discovers the archive’s cycles are part of a larger pattern. Vessa hunts loud channels and misses the quiet one.

# Voice
See: `voice_guide.md`

# Outline
Summary: Three parts—Setup, Pressure, Decision. Eight short chapters with specific beats, alternating intensity, and exits that leave small open loops.

# Characters
Summary: Close‑POV ensemble centered on Mara with Jae and Vessa as orbiting poles; the Archive acts as a stabilizing presence.

# Notes
- Core question: How do small, honest moves outlast loud, brittle ones?
- Motif: breath as a measure; paper maps with blank corridors; dim green LEDs.
- Constraints: no omniscient exposition; show tech through human edges; keep chapters short and forward.
