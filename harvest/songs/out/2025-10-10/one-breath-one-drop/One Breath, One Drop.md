# Inspiration

A simple mindfulness hymn in reggae clothes. Verses name tiny scenes—steam on a cup, a bus stop hush—then the chorus lands: “One breath, one drop.” Melodica takes the middle as a wordless prayer.

# Notes (optional)

Variation: feature a melodica‑led [Instrumental Break]. Keep solo lyrical, not busy. Echo tail kisses the downbeat back into the chorus.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Gentle roots reggae at 72 BPM; one‑drop drums, warm bass, off‑beat guitar upstrokes, organ bubble; include a lyrical [Instrumental Break] (melodica‑led) in the middle. Soulful lead vocal with stacked harmonies on chorus. Use spring reverb and light tape echo on chorus tags.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Soft melodica motif; shakers enter]

[Verse 1]
Steam from cup and hands at rest,
City hush inside the chest.
Count to four and feel it stop—
One long breath, one gentle drop.

[Chorus]
One breath, one drop,
Let the busy motion stop.
One breath, one drop—
Find the ground and let it rock.

[Verse 2]
Bus stop crowd and morning grey,
All these hearts in quiet sway.
Hear the room fall into time—
Every life on the same line.

[Instrumental Break]
[Melodica sings the chorus melody]

[Chorus]
One breath, one drop,
Find the ground and let it rock.

[Outro]
[Motif returns; fading echo]
