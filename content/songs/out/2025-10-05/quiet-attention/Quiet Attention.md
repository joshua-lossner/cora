# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Silence as instrument; breath before tone]

[Head A]
[Tenor sax whispers the motif]

[Head B]
[Guitar outlines chords; Rhodes leaves air]

[Solo 1]
[Sax — a few sentences, not a speech]

[Instrumental Break]
[Trio: Rhodes, bass, brushes for 8 bars]

[Head A]
[Return to motif; softer still]

[Outro]
[Brushes close; bass heartbeat]
