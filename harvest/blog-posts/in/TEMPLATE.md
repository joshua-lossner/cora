# Raw Input

Write what's on your mind. This could be:
- A confusing article or news piece you want to make sense of
- A thought pattern you're noticing
- A question you're wrestling with
- An observation that feels significant

No need to be coherent yetâ€”this is the compost pile.

# What I'm Trying to Understand

What's the confusion or tension here? What question am I actually asking?

# Initial Coherenceism Connections (optional)

Any hunches about which coherenceism principles might apply:
- Resonance as Truth
- Compost Cycles
- Alignment over Force
- Presence as Foundation
- Field Stewardship
- Living Traditions
- Technology as Amplifier
- Mature Uncertainty
- Nested Coherence

# Notes (optional)

Any constraints, audiences, or angles to explore.
