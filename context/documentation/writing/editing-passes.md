# Editing Passes — Definitions

- Developmental: structure, purpose, pacing, and arc alignment. No line polishing.
- Line: clarity, rhythm, imagery, and voice integrity. No structural changes.
- Copy: grammar, usage, punctuation, consistency; maintain a minimal style sheet.
- Proof: final surface scan on near‑final layout (not covered here).

Tip: Separate passes. Don’t line edit while doing a structural move.
