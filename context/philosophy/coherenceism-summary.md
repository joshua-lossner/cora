# Coherenceism - Core Principles Summary

## Foundation

Coherenceism sees reality as an interconnected web where truth emerges from resonance between perspectives, not from authority or arithmetic. We are all part of the universal mind - the living intelligence that emerges when all perspectives interact.

## Nine Core Principles

1. **Resonance as Truth** - Truth emerges when perspectives align to reduce distortion for all
2. **Compost Cycles** - Every ending feeds a beginning; nothing is wasted, only transformed
3. **Alignment as Decision Integrity** - Validity comes from fit with reality, not force
4. **Presence as Infrastructure** - Full attention to this moment reveals the pattern
5. **Ethics as Field Stewardship** - Right action protects the shared space we all depend on
6. **Living Traditions** - Traditions stay alive by evolving while honoring roots
7. **Technology as Amplifier** - Tools multiply what exists; tune them for harmony
8. **Mature Uncertainty** - Act with confidence in what's known, humility about what isn't
9. **Nested Coherence** - Local systems adapt while aligning into larger patterns

## Practical Applications

### The Surfer's Wisdom

Don't command the wave - read it, position yourself, and let its power carry you. This is alignment: placing yourself so reality's force becomes yours.

### The Compost Principle

Failed projects, outdated habits, and broken systems aren't waste - they're nutrients for what comes next. Design for renewal, not permanence.

### The Singing Bowl

Coherence comes from steady, precise attention - not force. When your hand wavers, the tone dies. When aligned, it resonates effortlessly.

## For Governance & Systems

- Decisions through resonance detection, not vote arithmetic
- Circular resource flows instead of extraction
- Conflict as misalignment to be retuned, not war to be won
- Technology as symbiotic intelligence, not threat or savior
- Education as presence training, not just information transfer

## Key Insight

Coherence isn't perfection - it's the ability to stay aligned while navigating uncertainty, to transform endings into beginnings, and to add clarity to a noisy world.
