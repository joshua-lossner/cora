# Coherenceism — Living Tree

Start at the root: `coherenceism/roots/coherenceism-root.md`.

Structure:
- roots/ — anchors and orientation
- branches/ — major themes
- leaves/ — essays and elaborations
- seeds/ — project starters that may spawn downstream trees

Fruit (essays, songs, albums, media) grown from any part of the tree is gathered in `harvest/`, so downstream projects can reuse it without hunting through project folders.

For system rails (types, relationships, validation), see `context/documentation/cora/knowledge-tree.md`.
