# Inspiration

Ocean cadence and city traffic sync to the same slow wave. Verses paint a surfer reading the set; chorus turns it inward: “Ride, don’t force.” Horns answer the hook with a rising two‑note call.

# Notes (optional)

Keep pocket slightly behind the click; emphasize laid‑back push/pull. Use a short horn stab after “ride.”

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 78 BPM, laid‑back one‑drop with round bass, off‑beat guitar upstrokes, organ bubble; horns answer the hook with a two‑note call. Warm soulful lead, stacked harmonies on the chorus; tasteful spring reverb/tape echo. Include a short [Instrumental Break] with dub‑style echoes and keep timing slightly behind the click.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Sea noise low; horns answer guitar]

[Verse 1]
Watch the sets roll in and breathe,
Learn the water, feel beneath.
You can’t push the ocean’s course—
Find the line and ride its force.

[Chorus]
Ride, don’t force,
Let the current be your source.
Ride, don’t force—
Lean and hold the course.

[Verse 2]
City lights and evening rain,
Signals flow through every lane.
When the rhythm finds your feet,
Move with it, not against the beat.

[Chorus]
Ride, don’t force,
Let the current be your source.

[Instrumental Break]
[Echo horn stabs; organ bubble and bass converse]

[Chorus]
Ride, don’t force—
Lean and hold the course.

[Outro]
[Horns reprise the two‑note call]
