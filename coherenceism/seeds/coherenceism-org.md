# Seed — Coherenceism.org (Handbook)

Collect community documentation and governance patterns aligned with Coherenceism. Provide clear, adaptable guidelines and policy templates that institutions and local groups can use without adopting dogma.

## Germination Notes
- Scope: community guidelines, moderation playbooks, meeting rhythms, decision frameworks, and transparency templates.
- Shape: start with a handbook; expand to modular policy templates that can be remixed.
- Consumers: local groups, civic orgs, online communities, and internal teams.

## MVP Slice
- Handbook v0.1 with: community guidelines, moderation basics, decision framework (resonance checks), and a sample meeting cadence.
- 3 policy templates: code of conduct, incident response, transparency log.
- Clear attribution and versioning on each template.

## Rails
- CORA holds canonical text; `.org` site renders and distributes.
- Version and changelog each page; note provenance and updates.

## Guardrails
- Non‑sectarian, vendor‑neutral language; avoid ideology.
- Practical over prescriptive; offer choices and trade‑offs.

## Success Signals
- Orgs adopt at least one module with minimal customization.
- Revisions driven by field use, not theory.

## Next Steps (Downstream)
1) Initialize `coherenceism.org` repo/site; include CORA as read‑only submodule.
2) Draft Handbook v0.1 with 4 core pages; publish and invite feedback.
3) Add template download packs (Markdown + PDF) with version tags.
