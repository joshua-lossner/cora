# Inspiration

The belly of the Ministry of Truth: pneumatic tubes hiss, speakwrites clatter, memory holes swallow the past. Machines rewrite history in real time. No melody, no vocalsâ€”only the industrial symphony of totalitarian bureaucracy. Surveillance pings echo through concrete corridors. Distant propaganda broadcasts blur into mechanical white noise.

# Notes (optional)

- Pure soundscape interlude, no traditional structure
- Focus on mechanical rhythms: typewriter clicks, printing press thuds, gear rotations
- Could include distorted propaganda voice samples (unintelligible)
- Surveillance ping continues but buried in the industrial texture
- Transition into this should feel like descending into factory machinery
