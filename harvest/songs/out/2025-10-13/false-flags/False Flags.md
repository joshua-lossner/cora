# Inspiration
Decoys everywhere; build a breath-paced double confirmation. Hold steady against urgent noise.

# Style Prompt
Downtempo 84–88 BPM; analog pads, muted bass, soft percussive textures (no splashy cymbals), close‑miked vocals with whisper harmonies. Tension theme: decoys and double‑confirmation; chorus resolves into calm certainty. [Intro: feed scroll SFX subtle] [Break: breath‑paced double tap] Negatives: no overt drops, no harsh distortion, no supersaw stacks.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[A feed scrolls, then dims]

[Verse 1]
Five bright alerts in a row
Each one insisting it knows
Urgent vests on ordinary days
Motion disguises its ways

[Chorus]
Wait for breath, then confirm
Twice around before you turn
Noise will beg you to move fast
Hold your line, let panic pass

[Verse 2]
Corner you favor lights up
Counts don’t match when you check them up
Mirror the urge and let it fade
Gentle refusal is brave

[Bridge]
[Tap — wait — tap]
Right stake rises in the gap

[Chorus]
Wait for breath, then confirm
Twice around before you turn
Noise will beg you to move fast
Hold your line, let panic pass

[Outro]
[Alarm test chorale; then off]
