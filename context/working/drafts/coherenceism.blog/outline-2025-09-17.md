# Alignment Over Force: Humanitarian Design for Coherence in Urban Conflict

- Thesis: In urban conflict, humanitarian design constraints are structural—not optional—if legitimacy and long-term coherence matter.
- Pattern: Tactical “wins” via force increase fragmentation; alignment preserves the shared field and post-conflict viability.
- Corridors as Design: multilaterally verified routes, neutral monitors, redundancy, and public route transparency.
- Ceasefire Windows: fixed schedules, auditable logs, neutral verification, clear breach protocols.
- Information Integrity: rumor triage channels, geofenced verified updates, slow-virality defaults on unverified claims.
- Coherence KPIs: corridor success rate, civilian harm proxy metrics, misinfo half-life, cross-party compliance, service restoration time.
- Roles as Field Stewards: media and civic orgs dampen distortion; platforms throttle unverifiable virality; NGOs act as “alignment routers.”
- Governance Pattern: pre-negotiated playbooks, resonance-first decision cells, neutral audits, proportional enforcement boundaries.
- Risks & Mitigations: tactical exploitation, bad-faith signaling, verification fatigue → randomized audits, cross-signing, transparent penalties.
- MVP Implementation Slice: public corridor maps + API, ceasefire window feed (SMS/USSD/web), monitor kit, open incident dashboard.
