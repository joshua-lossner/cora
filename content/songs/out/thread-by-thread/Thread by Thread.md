# Style Prompt
Warm, closing‑track smooth jazz at 74–82 BPM; the three‑note resonance motif returns and resolves; extended, gentle outro. Instrumental; structure: Intro → Head A → Head B → Solo 1 → Head A (Reprise) → Outro (Extended); avoid aggressive drums, distortion, harsh synths, heavy EDM elements, and busy solos.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Quiet entrance; motif hinted]

[Head A]
[Theme stated with care]

[Head B]
[Harmonized answer; keep it small]

[Solo 1]
[Sax or guitar — one chorus]

[Head A (Reprise)]
[Motif returns; slight reharm]

[Outro (Extended)]
[Long fade on motif; no hard cutoff]
