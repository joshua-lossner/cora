# Inspiration
Power cycles align with transit windows; a single LED blink answers in time.

# Style Prompt
Downtempo/ambient ~84 BPM; analog pads, steady soft drums, warm piano ostinato; intimate lead vocal with whisper doubles. Motifs: power cycle test blink, subway hiss; chorus opens into a simple, confident hook. [Intro: power test light blink SFX] [Break: held breath into downbeat] Negatives: no big drops, no piercing leads, no heavy wash.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Light test: blink; subway hiss]

[Verse 1]
02:07, lights shiver thin
02:08, a train breathes in
Numbers turn a hidden key
Windows open quietly

[Chorus]
Open channel, say it once
In the space between the hums
Count and breathe, align the line
A single blink replies in time

[Verse 2]
Tape rolls on a patient reel
Pauses carry what is real
Rooms that refuse to speak
Answer when we do not seek

[Bridge]
[Held breath; then release]
Wood settles like a peace

[Chorus]
Open channel, say it once
In the space between the hums
Count and breathe, align the line
A single blink replies in time

[Outro]
[LEDâ€”one blink; silence]
