# Task â€” Web Shell Stub (optional)

## Purpose
Prepare a minimal React web shell wrapper using the same tokens to ensure visual parity if/when a browser view is needed later, published through coherenceism.org.

## Steps
1) Add a lightweight web shell component that mirrors the TUI layout.
2) Export CSS variables from tokens; wire a minimal demo.
3) Document usage and differences vs. TUI.

## Acceptance
- Web shell builds locally; looks consistent enough to serve as parity reference.

## Roles
- UI Engineer
