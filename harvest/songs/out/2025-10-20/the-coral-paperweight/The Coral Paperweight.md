# Inspiration

The room above Mr. Charrington's shop: sunlight through dusty windows, the coral trapped in glass, Julia's touch. For a stolen moment, warmth bleeds into the mechanical cold—Rhodes piano emerges like memory, guitar traces fragile hope. But the surveillance ping never disappears, only recedes. The drum machines loosen slightly, almost human. This beauty is borrowed time, a paperweight holding down a world already condemned to shatter.

# Style Prompt

Industrial post-punk at 100 BPM with fragile warmth breaking through; warm Rhodes piano bleeding through static, subtle clean electric guitar, cold synths receding to background, softer bass, mechanical drums loosening toward human feel. Male baritone passionate whisper showing brief tenderness. Include Pre-Chorus build. Surveillance "ping" quieter but still present (threat remains). Both warm and cold elements battle for space in Bridge. No triumphant delivery—warmth is endangered, not victorious.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Warm Rhodes emerges through static; clean guitar tentative]

[Verse 1]
Dusty window, stolen light,
The coral trapped in glass.
One room above the junk shop floor—
A moment we can't make last.

[Pre-Chorus]
The telescreen's off, but somewhere near,
They're listening, always near.

[Chorus]
Hold the paperweight, hold the fragile thing,
Beauty borrowed from a world that's breaking.
Touch my hand before the watchers come—
This warmth won't last, but it's still something.

[Verse 2]
Your voice cuts through the static hum,
A human sound survives.
The Party owns tomorrow's page,
But tonight we're still alive.

[Bridge]
[Warm Rhodes and cold synths battle]
Stolen hours in a rented room,
We know how this story ends—
But let me hold this coral light
Before the signal sends.

[Chorus]
Hold the paperweight, hold the fragile thing,
Beauty borrowed from a world that's breaking.
Touch my hand before the watchers come—
This warmth won't last, but it's still something.

[Outro]
[Rhodes fades; cold synths return; surveillance ping grows louder]
