# Procedures

## Purpose
Reusable capabilities with minimal frontmatter and human-readable usage.

## Structure
- Root index: `procedures/INDEX.md` (human index; keep updated)
- Categories (subfolders):
  - `core/` — cora maintenance, validation, context loaders
  - `git/` — git hygiene and workflows
  - `forest/` — tree scaffolding and submodule utilities
  - `writing/` — summarization and editorial helpers
  - `research/` — signal scanning and pattern extraction
  - `philosophy/` — alignment checks and reviews
  - `compliance/` — privacy/ethics reviews
- Templates: `procedures/_templates/`

## Notes
- Keep procedure filenames kebab-case and action-oriented.
- Prefer tags and categories in frontmatter for discoverability.
- Cross-link procedures that often chain.
