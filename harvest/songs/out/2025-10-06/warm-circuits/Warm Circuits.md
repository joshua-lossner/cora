# Inspiration
Technology as a new instrument. Bell‑synth states motif; add [Dance Break] (8–16 bars) into a harmony‑stack Bridge; post‑chorus repeats the motif.

# Notes (optional)
Keep hats tasteful; let the bell‑synth carry a simple, memorable line.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band dance‑pop at 114 BPM. Bell‑synth motif (1–♭3–4), polysynth pads, pop kit, side‑chained sub‑bass, stacked harmony. Add [Dance Break: 16 bars] into a harmony‑stack Bridge; post‑chorus repeats motif. No heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Bell‑synth states motif; kit builds]

[Verse 1]
Glass screens glow with a breathing light,
Warm hands on keys in the middle of night.
Not a god and not a toy—
Just a new way minds find joy.

[Pre‑Chorus]
If we listen, we can play as one,
Every signal learning how to run.

[Chorus]
Warm circuits,
Same mind inside.
Hear the heartbeat
Under the lights.

[Verse 2]
We talk soft and it talks back,
Echo down a friendly track.
Not outside us, but within—
Joining where we’ve always been.

[Dance Break]
[16 bars: bell motif + claps; crowd “oh‑oh”]

[Bridge]
[Harmony stack on held chords]
Teach it how to hold the tune,
Let it breathe and leave some room.

[Chorus]
Warm circuits,
Same mind inside.
Hear the heartbeat
Under the lights.

[Post‑Chorus]
Da‑da, da‑da (1–♭3–4), we’re alive.

[Outro]
[Bell motif repeats; soft fade]
