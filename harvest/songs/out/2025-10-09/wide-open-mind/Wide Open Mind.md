# Inspiration
A horizon highway at golden hour. The radio hums like a tuning fork, and every fencepost flicker feels connected to the next. Verse images open the field—wind in the grass, lines on the road—then the chorus lands simple: “wide open mind.” The bridge lifts with organ and BGVs before easing back to a soft, grateful outro.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Give me that wide, wide open mind.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul at 82 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurlitzer/Rhodes, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums with tambourine; male baritone with gentle grit and small gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus] lift and a double [Chorus]; conversational phrasing; tape‑warm room. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Organ swell; guitar with light tremolo]

[Verse 1]
Long road breathing in the light,
Fenceposts flicker left and right.
Wind says every line is tied—
I open up and let it ride.

[Pre‑Chorus]
I’ve been holding life too tight,
Let the field make me wide.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Verse 2]
Gravel song beneath the tires,
Sunlight threads through phone‑line wires.
Every little rusted sign
Points me to the living line.

[Bridge]
[BGVs swell; Hammond lifts]
If it’s love, it won’t be forced,
Lean with wind and ride the course.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Chorus]
Give me that wide, wide open mind,
Let the whole world fall in time.

[Outro]
[Ad‑lib guitar; resonance tag on organ]
