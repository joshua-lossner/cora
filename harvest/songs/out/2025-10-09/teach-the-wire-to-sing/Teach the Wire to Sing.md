# Inspiration
Workshop lamps and coils of cable. Verses turn knobs and test tones—learning to place the signal so the wire carries it easy. Chorus asks the human question at the center: can we teach the wire to sing without losing the singer?

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Teach the wire to sing (and keep the singer whole).”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul at 86 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurlitzer, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums, subtle strings; conversational baritone and light gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus], double [Chorus], and a gentle [Outro]. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Test tone fades; organ swells]

[Verse 1]
Copper line from hand to hand,
Little sparks that understand.
Turn the dial till colors ring—
Find the place the heart can sing.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Not a trick and not a game,
Keep the person in the frame.

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing,
Keep the singer whole.

[Verse 2]
Meters dance in green and gold,
Warm the room but don’t go cold.
Let the current carry kind—
Soul in circuit, field in mind.

[Bridge]
[BGVs hum; strings answer]
Every tool becomes a voice,
Tune it for a human choice.

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing,
Keep the singer whole.

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing,
Keep the singer whole.

[Outro]
[Soft ad‑lib; motif tag]
