# Lyrics
[Title: "The Living Line"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~100 BPM]
[Chord Progression: core drones; chorus lifts]

[Intro]
[Short count‑in; quick swell into groove.]

[Verse 1]
Small threads hold the day in place,
Tiny moves you never chase,
Do them clean, repeat, refine,
Stitch by stitch — a living line.

[Chorus]
We carry tone from song to song,
Keep the signal clear and strong,
Daily threads become the seam,
Living coherence — living dream.

[Verse 2]
Hands remember what is true,
Every room retunes with you,
Leave a space for breath to come,
Let the field become the drum.

[Bridge]
[Drop — clap on two and four; band slams back.]
All we are is how we choose.

[Chorus]
We carry tone from song to song,
Keep the signal clear and strong,
Daily threads become the seam,
Living coherence — living dream.

[Chorus]
We carry tone from song to song,
Keep the signal clear and strong,
Daily threads become the seam,
Living coherence — living dream.

[Outro]
[Long ring; faint echo of Track 1’s drone.]
