# Inspiration

Life is the scary movie—uncertainty, mortality, the door that might open onto loss. But you're not the character on screen running from the monster. You're awareness itself, watching. This is a brief ambient meditation on presence practice: the gap between the story and the witness. Let real sounds speak—footsteps, wind, breath—without horror theatrics. Just presence held in sound.

# Style Prompt

Minimal ambient soundscape with soft spoken word, 90-120 seconds. Field recordings (footsteps, wind, rain, door creaking—real sounds, not horror SFX), layered singing bowls (432 Hz), barely-there synth pad. Includes 5 seconds of active silence. Vocals are witnessing presence, not performance—breath audible. No traditional structure, no dramatic builds, no horror effects.

# Lyrics / Text

[Soundscape begins: distant wind, footsteps on wood]

[Spoken, soft]
You're watching a scary movie
But you're not the one on screen

[Singing bowl tone enters]

The footsteps in the hall—
Just footsteps
The creak of the door—
Just wood and time

[Field recording: door creaking open, rain beginning]

[Sung, barely above speaking]
The story says run
But you're not in the story
You're the watching
The steady breath beneath the fear

[Silence—5 seconds with just room tone and distant rain]

[Spoken]
Uncertainty is the plot
Mortality is the setting
Change is every scene

[Multiple singing bowls, layered]

But you—
You are the awareness holding it all
Not the victim
The witness

[Field recordings fade: rain, wind, breath]

[Singing bowls sustain and slowly fade]

The scary movie plays
And you watch
Present
Here

[Final singing bowl rings into silence]

# Notes

- This is ambient/minimal—90 to 120 seconds total
- Field recordings should be real, not horror SFX: actual footsteps, actual door, actual rain
- Spoken word delivery is calm, present—almost like meditation guidance
- Singing bowls are the through-line, grounding presence
- Include genuine silence (5 seconds) in the middle—active emptiness
- Let the final bowl ring for 8-10 seconds into complete quiet
- No "song" structure—this is a soundscape with witnessed text
