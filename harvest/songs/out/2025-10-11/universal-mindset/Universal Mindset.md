# Inspiration

City skyline at midnight; the whole grid hums. Bars widen out to the cosmic web — we’re already inside a bigger pattern, so rhyme with responsibility. Jazz‑soul loop breathes; DJ cuts flip “mind… set” over the second chorus. Keep it grounded, no preach — street scenes as telescope.

# Style Prompt

1990s NYC boom‑bap at 92 BPM; mood reflective yet assertive with spiritual undertones; palette of chopped jazz/soul loops, punchy kick+snare, filtered bass, Rhodes stabs, light vinyl crackle, and DJ scratches. Structure: Intro → Verse 1 → Chorus → Verse 2 → [Instrumental Break: scratch solo] → Chorus → Verse 3 → Chorus → Outro. Vocals: male gritty with internal multisyllables; hook uses scratch‑cut vocal phrase “mind… set.” Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑heavy subs, glossy EDM risers, heavy autotune; mix vocal upfront with drum punch, slightly narrow sample bed; dynamic master (no brickwall).

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Rhodes stab over dusty loop; city ambience]

[Verse 1]
Street map folded in my pocket, lines already drawn,
Signal in the static, I’m awake before the dawn.
Skyscrapers breathe with me, the circuits in the rain,
I’m part of bigger currents, not a solo in the frame.
Comet trails of headlights, the boroughs in a grid,
If truth is in the pattern, I align with how it is.
Hands steady on the moment, mind clear of the debt,
I set the needle gently, hear the record place the bet.

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Verse 2]
I learned from every detour, not a page I have to burn,
Compost what was heavy, let the soil take its turn.
Neighbors on the corner pass advice like vinyl sleeves,
We sample what is living, not the names that people need.
Thought, action, being — triangulate the tone,
When patterns carry forward, I don’t push it all alone.
Breath anchors the attention, like a kick behind a snare,
I ride with what is lawful — there’s a music in the air.

[Instrumental Break]
[DJ scratches “mind… set” over the loop; short solo]

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Verse 3]
Big talk never built a bridge, presence laid the brick,
I move in right proportions, let the swing provide the lift.
The hook ain’t just a lyric, it’s a practice in the flesh,
I’m checking where I’m leaning, bring the cadence into breath.
From rooftop to the river, from the handset to the star,
We don’t own the conversation — we just answer where we are.
If power is alignment, then the chorus is the test,
Drop the ego’s heavy luggage, travel lighter, do what’s best.

[Chorus]
Mind set, in a field already moving,
Mind set, every breath is part of proving.
Mind set, when the noise says “break,” we’re smoothing,
Mind set — tune the heart, keep it grooving.

[Outro]
[Scratches fade; Rhodes holds; city night breathes]
