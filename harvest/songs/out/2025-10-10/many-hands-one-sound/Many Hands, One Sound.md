# Inspiration

Market‑day joy: vendors calling, children weaving through legs, a band on the corner holding the pocket. Chorus is a simple crowd sing—“Many hands, one sound.” Horns take a short feature to echo the call.

# Notes (optional)

Variation: insert a horn‑led [Instrumental Break] between Verse 2 and Chorus. Keep lines unison → harmony.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Rocksteady‑leaning roots at 84 BPM; one‑drop pocket with lively off‑beat guitar, organ bubble, and a bright horn section. Call‑and‑response chorus; insert a short [Instrumental Break] (horn‑led) between Verse 2 and Chorus. Spring reverb/tape echo for taste; keep the groove buoyant.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Band count‑in; horn pickup]

[Verse 1]
Market morning, call and cheer,
Hands pass peaches, laughter near.
Drum and bass make common ground—
Many hands become one sound.

[Chorus]
Many hands, one sound,
Lift it up and pass it ’round.
Many hands, one sound—
This is how we move the town.

[Verse 2]
Grandma hums a Sunday line,
Kids clap time and fall in time.
Neighbors nod and sing it loud—
Many hands become one sound.

[Instrumental Break]
[Unison to three‑part harmony; short, melodic]

[Chorus]
Many hands, one sound,
Lift it up and pass it ’round.

[Instrumental Break]
[Echo horn stabs; upstroke guitar answers]

[Chorus]
Many hands, one sound—
This is how we move the town.

[Outro]
[Horns tag the hook]
