# Inspiration

Leave air in the mix; let silence speak. Verses point at what can’t be said head‑on — paradox, luminous edges of being. The hook is a short, chant‑like phrase with room to breathe.

# Style Prompt

’90s boom‑bap with soft swing at 90 BPM; airy Rhodes/pad, minimal chops, gentle kick+snare; wide sense of space; chant‑like hook. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Outro. Vocals: quiet intensity, slower phrasing with room for breath. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, sub‑dominant 808s, glossy risers, heavy autotune; vocal‑forward, dynamic and airy mix.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Airy pad; faint vinyl hush]

[Verse 1]
I can point but I can’t package what the edges try to show —
Like a lamplight on a river, truth is moving as it glows.
Every time I try to trap it in a tidy little phrase,
It dissolves like fog at sunrise, leaves a warmth and leaves a haze.
So I rhyme around the outline, let the silence write a bar,
Give the chorus room to hover like a message from afar.
If I’m faithful to the feeling more than owning what it means,
Then the mystery stays luminous, not flattened by my schemes.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Verse 2]
Some truths wear a hooded garment, keep their faces out of sight,
If you drag them into daylight, they stop singing, stop their light.
Better walk with them in whispers, keep your steps a softer time,
Let the beat suggest the meaning like a shadow under rhyme.
I’ve been wrong when I was certain, I’ve been right when I was small —
When I’m humble, I can hear it; when I’m loud, I miss the call.
So the chorus isn’t answer; it’s the clearing on the trail —
We stand still and let the forest tell the next part of the tale.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Verse 3]
In the pauses of a city, in the breath between replies,
In the way a record crackle makes the present sound alive —
There’s a knowing without wording, there’s a seeing without eyes,
Not a riddle to be conquered, but a weather in the skies.
So I end without an ending, like a circle never done,
Let the needle lift with reverence for what’s bigger than my tongue.
If you feel it, you don’t name it; if you name it, let it go —
We can stand here in the shimmer, that’s enough for what we know.

[Chorus]
Leave room — let the mystery speak,
Leave room — let the silence teach.
Leave room — we’re the choir and the reach,
Leave room — for the luminous beneath.

[Outro]
[Air and pad; soft fade]
