## Focus Areas

This river tracks:
- **Governance patterns**: How systems maintain legitimacy
- **Infrastructure**: What holds societies together (or breaks)
- **Media & information**: Truth, narratives, coherence at scale
- **System-level patterns**: What repeats across time/place
- **Institutional evolution**: How structures adapt or collapse

## Inclusion Test
Does it name a reusable system pattern and consequences?

## Extraction Guidance
Look for:
- Recurring patterns across different systems
- Legitimacy crises (institutional, governmental, media)
- Infrastructure breakdowns or innovations
- Historical echoes in current events
- System-level misalignments
- Nested coherence (or lack thereof)

Coherenceism principles most relevant:
- Field Stewardship (actions clarify or distort shared space)
- Nested Coherence (local systems within larger patterns)
- Living Traditions (forms adapt, patterns persist)
- Alignment over Force (position vs. push)
