# Inspiration

Endings don’t vanish; they transform. Verses lean into unease and decay textures; the bridge drops to near‑silence before the chorus resolves with the held‑note motif returning as a reminder that change is compost, not collapse.

# Notes (optional)

- Use feedback swells as “dissolve” cues between sections.
