# Procedure — Expand Chapter to Target

Purpose
- Add meaningful material (not filler) to reach target length: micro‑scenes, lived examples, interiority, setting texture, and concrete beats that advance character/plot.

Inputs
- chapter draft body
- target_per_chapter and tolerance
- outline beats and character bible

Steps
1) Gap assessment
   - Compute current words and gap to target; choose 2–4 areas to deepen (scene start/end, interior beat, setting texture, small obstacle).
2) Add micro‑scenes
   - Insert 1–2 mini beats that change state/knowledge/relationship; keep them concrete and short.
3) Interiority & texture
   - Add 1–3 sentences per major beat that reveal interior stakes or sensory specifics; avoid abstract summary.
4) Examples & objects
   - Ground ideas with an object/action; use a small worked example rather than exposition.
5) Smooth transitions
   - Add or tighten transitions so the added material flows; avoid bloating.

Expected
- Chapter within target ± tolerance; added material produces visible turns, not padding.

Operator Prompt (Ivy)
"""
You are expanding a chapter to reach a target length without filler.
Given the current body and target, add micro‑scenes, interiority, and sensory specifics that create small turns or deepen stakes. Keep additions concrete and brief. Return the revised chapter body only.
