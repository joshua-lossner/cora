# Beats
- Jae takes her to a room tuned for silence.
- They test the city’s “gaps” timing window.
- Vessa’s probe hits a friend’s network.
- A quiet signal fails; wrong stakes.
- They alter the pattern — small move, new cost.

# Chapter
The room had no purpose but to subtract. Jae unlocked it with a key that looked like a blank and set his phone face down. Walls wore the velvet of theaters and there was a rug that looked expensive and felt like absence. When he closed the door, the world offered a held breath they could shape.

They didn’t speak. He raised a hand and tapped the air at a steady pace a metronome would respect; she matched, drifted a hair late, then corrected. He lifted two fingers and she let her pulse fall into a pattern she knew: transit cycles, power tests, the soft stagger of the archive when generators ticked over.

Her friend Mira texted and the phone on the table lit without sound. The preview flash said nothing and everything: system down? Vessa in the neighborhood. Jae glanced once and then away. “Wrong window,” he said quietly, as if to the room. They did nothing again and she felt the panic wash through them and drain.

When they tried a signal — a tiny one, the kind you’d miss if you weren’t waiting — the timing collapsed under them. What they’d chosen to mark wasn’t worth marking and the city punished the arrogance with a shiver of alarms, not here, but everywhere in her nerves. She flinched; Jae shook his head and tapped out a slower bar.

“We change us,” he said, and shifted his breath by a fraction. She followed. The window opened not wider but cleaner. The rug softened her step into the beat. Somewhere outside a car alarm keened and then died like a gull that found only air.

The phone vibrated once on a dead table. They both smiled without moving their mouths, then closed the session like people leaving a church: deliberate, ordinary, carrying a stillness out.
