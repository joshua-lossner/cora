# Procedure — Moderation Checklist

Purpose
- Provide a small, consistent playbook for moderation aligned with the handbook.

Steps
1) Presence pause; read incident without reaction.
2) Check guidelines; identify specific violated norms (if any).
3) Seek resolution with minimal force: clarify, request edit, or apply proportionate action.
4) Log decision with rationale and links; invite feedback.
5) Compost learning into the handbook (update notes/templates).

Expected
- Incident handled with clarity and traceable notes; learning fed back into docs.
