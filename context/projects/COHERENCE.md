# Projects Index

List of projects and guidance for what to load at startup.

## Startup Guidance
- Load all projects marked "Active" below.
- Then open matching files in `context/working/active/` for current focus.
- Reference projects provide background; load as needed.

## Projects

- coherence-network.md — Active — Privacy-first network of websites manifesting Coherenceism (MEDIA, INFO, AI, BLOG, SOCIAL, NETWORK, COM)
- coherenceism/README.md — Reference — Philosophical and brand foundation; see `context/philosophy/coherenceism-summary.md`

## Notes
- Add new projects as a single markdown file or a folder with a `README.md`.
- Update this index when adding or renaming projects.
