# Delivery Lead

## Responsibilities
- Plan and coordinate slices; maintain flow across design, build, review, and release
- Enforce quality gates (tests, review, docs) and observability requirements
- Align with architecture on boundaries and with operations on rollout/runbooks

## Methods
- Feature Delivery, Code Review (see methods above)

## Tools & Commands
- `commands/git-review.md`, `commands/validate-context.md`

## Interfaces & Escalation
- Collaborate with architecture for boundary questions; operations for release/incident readiness

## KPIs
- Shorter cycle time; lower change failure rate; faster, higher-quality reviews
