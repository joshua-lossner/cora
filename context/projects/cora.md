## Purpose
Evolve the CORA trunk (canon content, rails, roles, and procedures) and keep onboarding/operations coherent and accessible.

## Scope
- Canon content and rails (ontology, philosophy, roles/procedures)
- Onboarding and operator docs
- Forest index shape and seed lineage
- No downstream UI or code (lives in other repos)

## Tasks (Summary)
- [ ] context/project-tasks/cora/establish-branching-strategy.md:1
- [ ] context/project-tasks/cora/roles-procedures-forest.md:1
- [ ] context/project-tasks/cora/track-prs.md:1

## PRs (Log)

## Next Small Moves

- Run content validator and note any fixes.
- Draft a minimal “Example PR” under `procedures/git/open_pull_request.md:1` if we find gaps.
