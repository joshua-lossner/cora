# Daily Log — 2025-10-07

## Entries

### 2025-10-07T20:06:18-0500 — procedure — scaffold Markdown logging system

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/logs/COHERENCE.md, context/logs/_templates/daily-log.md, context/logs/_templates/log-entry.md, procedures/core/update_log.md, AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Added logs index and templates; updated AGENTS conventions to require post‑change logging.
- Outcome: Logging is now a first‑class, Markdown‑driven capability in CORA.
- Follow-ups: Optionally add weekly roll-up in projects; encourage usage via role manifests.

### 2025-10-07T21:19:49-0500 — procedure — add backup strategy + session checkpoint

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/documentation/cora/backup-strategy.md, procedures/core/session_checkpoint.md, .env.example, AGENTS.md, context/tasks/cora/backup-strategy.md, context/tasks/cora/session-checkpoint-procedure.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md, procedures/core/session_checkpoint.md
- Summary: Documented local-first backup/sync policy; added session checkpoint procedure and optional mirror env; updated AGENTS conventions; marked tasks done.
- Outcome: Clear private backup plan; one-step session snapshots; optional iCloud mirror via CORA_SYNC_DIR.
- Follow-ups: After moving to iCloud, consider a weekly roll-up view in projects.

### 2025-10-07T21:17:16-0500 — context — rename project-tasks → tasks; add new tasks

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [context/tasks/*, context/COHERENCE.md, context/roles/project-manager.md, procedures/*, coherenceism/seeds/coherenceism-project.md, context/projects/*]
- Procedure/Workflow: n/a
- Summary: Renamed  to  and updated all references; added CORA tasks for backup strategy and session checkpoint.
- Outcome: Consistent  namespace; two new tasks ready under .
- Follow-ups: Implement the backup strategy doc and the session checkpoint procedure.

### 2025-10-07T21:51:56-0500 — context-edit — automate logging + snapshot defaults in AGENTS.md

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Added automation defaults: auto-log without prompts; end-of-session snapshot policy; env overrides and guardrails.
- Outcome: Agents auto-append provenance logs on writes; snapshots run per policy.
- Follow-ups: Review noise level after a week; tune thresholds.

### 2025-10-07T21:57:32-0500 — context-edit — remove session checkpoint procedure and references

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [procedures/core/session_checkpoint.md, AGENTS.md, .env.example, context/documentation/cora/backup-strategy.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Deleted session_checkpoint procedure as requested; updated AGENTS conventions and ENV comments; cleaned backup doc references.
- Outcome: No broken references in core docs; snapshot remains as optional/automated behavior (no separate procedure).
- Follow-ups: task file still references checkpoint procedure; confirm whether to archive or update.

### 2025-10-07T22:09:09-0500 — context-edit — lean Initial Load + COHERENCE.md schema

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [AGENTS.md, context/COHERENCE.md, context/strategy/COHERENCE.md, personas/COHERENCE.md, procedures/COHERENCE.md, context/methodologies/COHERENCE.md, context/projects/COHERENCE.md, context/roles/COHERENCE.md, workflows/COHERENCE.md, coherenceism/forest/COHERENCE.md, context/mcp/COHERENCE.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Defined lean startup (persona+philosophy, then COHERENCE sweep). Added COHERENCE.md schema with init.files and index.map; embedded minimal init blocks across indexes.
- Outcome: Faster initial load with consistent machine-readable indexes; no broad directory scans.
- Follow-ups: Add tiny loader procedure or script if desired; tune which init.files to include over time.

### 2025-10-07T22:17:38-0500 — context-edit — add Behavioral Hooks to AGENTS.md

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Documented doc-only hook semantics (SessionStart/UserPromptSubmit/Stop) to ensure Lean Load on greeting without code.
- Outcome: Greeting now implies automatic Lean Load by convention; ready state returned with a single confirmation line.
- Follow-ups: If we later adopt a CLI with hook support, map events accordingly; for now, behavior is policy-driven.

### 2025-10-07T22:23:47-0500 — context-edit — add Startup greeting behavior to AGENTS.md

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Documented proactive startup greeting (Markdown-only) and quiet Lean Load with one-line readiness.
- Outcome: On Codex launch, Ivy greets, loads CORA per Lean Load, and reports ready without extra chatter.
- Follow-ups: None. Behavior remains policy-only; no scripts required.

### 2025-10-07T22:40:30-0500 — context-edit — persona selection via greeting

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Allow selecting persona by mentioning its name/id in the first greeting; SessionStart now detects and loads that persona.
- Outcome: Operators can begin with “Hi Ivy …” or “Hi S'Vektor …” to load the desired persona automatically.
- Follow-ups: Optionally surface persona ids/names in personas/COHERENCE.md frontmatter for faster matching.

### 2025-10-07T22:44:12-0500 — context-edit — add personas index + persona voice policy

- Actor: ivy
- Paths: [personas/COHERENCE.md, AGENTS.md]
- Procedure/Workflow: procedures/core/update_log.md
- Summary: Added quick personas index (ids, names, paths) and documented that output style follows the active persona.
- Outcome: Faster discovery of persona ids; agent voice now explicitly tied to selected persona.
- Follow-ups: Consider a lightweight matcher procedure if more personas are added.
