# Inspiration

The worst thing in the world. The cage door opens. Everything breaks—the self, the love, the last human resistance. Synths scream. Drum machines assault. Industrial noise reaches maximum intensity. The surveillance ping distorts into a shriek. All warmth is obliterated. The human voice cracks from desperate scream to broken hollow. This is the fracture point where the person dies and only the shell remains.

# Style Prompt

Industrial harsh noise at 110 BPM; maximum intensity and chaos. Screaming distorted analog synths, overwhelming grinding bass, violent chaotic drum machines, crushing industrial noise dominates. Male baritone vocals break: start desperate screaming, end hollow and defeated. Extended harsh Instrumental Break with noise assault. Surveillance "ping" distorts into unrecognizable screech. All warmth completely erased. No beauty, melody, or stability—pure psychological collapse into noise.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Violent drum machines; synths screaming]

[Verse 1]
The door swings open, cage revealed,
Every nightmare given form.
They know the thing I fear the most—
The breaking point, the final storm.

[Chorus]
Take me instead, not what I love,
Break me, just spare them from above.
The worst thing in the world unfolds—
I'm fracturing, I'm losing hold.

[Verse 2]
All resistance turns to ash,
The self dissolves, the person dies.
No principle survives this room—
Only hollow, empty eyes.

[Bridge]
[Desperate, breaking voice]
Please, not this—anything but this—

[Instrumental Break]
[Maximum harsh industrial noise assault: 16 bars]
[All warmth obliterated; pure chaos]

[Chorus]
[Hollow, defeated voice]
I betrayed them all to save myself,
Nothing human left inside.
The cage has closed, the breaking's done—
The person that I was has died.

[Outro]
[Sudden stop or fade to broken static]
