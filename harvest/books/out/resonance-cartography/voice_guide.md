# Voice Guide — Resonance Cartography

## Voice Rails
- POV: second person (operator voice; occasional inclusive first‑plural for shared moves)
- Tense: present with simple past for short anecdotes
- Distance: medium‑close (practical and felt, not lofty)

## Diction & Cadence
- Diction: plain, concrete, gently lyrical when image clarifies a method
- Cadence: short→medium sentences with an occasional long, reflective line
- Imagery: small rooms, instruments, maps, kitchens, sidewalks; no abstraction without an image first

## Devices
- Allowed: scene→method (image, then rail); checklists; short vignettes; questions that open attention; diagrams when they remove jargon
- Negatives: no jargon without definition; no moralizing; no sweeping generalizations; no hand‑waving “culture” fixes

## Sample Lines
- Narration: You put the bowl on the table and listen until the room stops trying to impress you.
- Method: Map the people, the pressures, and the promises; name the ones you can’t see yet.
- Dialogue beat: “We’re late,” someone says. You nod, then ask which pressure is real and which is theater.
- Interiority: The signal is already here; the work is to tune until it carries you.
