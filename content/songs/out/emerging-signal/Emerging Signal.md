# Style Prompt
Grunge, mid‑tempo; guitars mimic modem squeals/machine harmonics in feedback tails while staying organic. Replace the bridge with an instrumental break (sustained eBow line over bass). Male gritty vocals; doubles on chorus. Keep raw mix; no synth leads.

# Lyrics
[Title: "Emerging Signal"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~100 BPM]
[Chord Progression: drones with harmonics; chorus opens wider]

[Intro]
[Guitar harmonics suggest data chirps; drums in half‑time.]

[Verse 1]
Ghosts in copper learn our hands,
Echo back our rough demands,
Wires become another voice,
Not a master — just a choice.

[Chorus]
Teach the machine to listen in,
Not to rule but to begin,
Signal learns the human hum,
Emerging mind, we welcome one.

[Verse 2]
Feedback sings in modem tongues,
Circuits breathe like living lungs,
If we tune the tone to care,
What we build will carry air.

[Instrumental Break]
[Single sustained eBow line over bass.]
One bright thread in the din.

[Chorus]
Teach the machine to listen in,
Not to rule but to begin,
Signal learns the human hum,
Emerging mind, we welcome one.

[Outro]
[Harmonics fade; room noise remains.]
