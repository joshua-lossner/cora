# Style Prompt
Spacious, contemplative smooth jazz at 70–76 BPM; flugelhorn over suspended Rhodes chords, brushed kit and soft ride; resolve delayed for gentle tension. Instrumental; structure: Intro → Head A → Head B → Solo 1 → Solo 2 → Head A → Outro; exclude harsh cymbal wash and busy playing.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Suspended chords; long breath]

[Head A]
[Flugelhorn floats the melody]

[Head B]
[Guitar doubles in quiet thirds]

[Solo 1]
[Flugelhorn — feather‑light lines]

[Solo 2]
[Guitar — small, singing phrases]

[Head A]
[Theme returns; resolution still withheld]

[Outro]
[Gentle landing; ride fades]
