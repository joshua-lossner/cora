# Inspiration

The worst thing in the world. The cage door opens. Rats. Everything breaks—the self, the love, the last human resistance. Synths scream. Drum machines assault. Industrial noise reaches maximum intensity. "Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia!" The surveillance ping distorts into a shriek. All warmth is obliterated. The human voice cracks from desperate scream to broken hollow. This is the fracture point where Winston Smith dies and only the shell remains.

# Notes (optional)

- Extend Bridge into harsh Instrumental Break (per album structure notes)
- Maximum intensity and chaos—industrial noise dominates
- Any Rhodes/guitar warmth from previous track must be completely erased
- Vocals should break: start desperate, end hollow and defeated
- Surveillance ping distorts into barely recognizable screech
- Could include distorted vocal sample: "Do it to Julia" moment
- Outro should feel like collapse—everything stops suddenly or fades to broken static
