# Concept
This is a grunge record about tuning in rather than turning up. Nine songs ride a single living tone—an amp’s quiet hum—through rain‑slick nights and basement rooms where the air moves with the drums. Drop‑D guitars, fuzz bass, and big‑room drums carry a heavy, mid‑tempo pulse; verses stay tense and close, choruses open like air after rain. Feedback isn’t a mistake here—it’s part of the instrument, a thread that stitches the record together. From the raw lift of Carrier Wave to the hard truth of Nothing Disappears and the communal roar of Many Hands, One Sound, the album keeps its grit and leaves the edges in. It’s catharsis without gloss, presence without pretense. We are the wire; the signal comes through.

# Tracklist
1. The Universal Mind — tuning into the field under everything; amp hum as carrier wave; opening invocation
2. Death, Change, and the Nature of Reality — compost cycles; endings transform; heavy unease that resolves
3. Coherence as Alignment — position over force; chorus opens like air after rain
4. The Practice of Presence — breath and restraint; one held note; dynamic control
5. Ethics and Action — choices that strengthen the field; driving groove; sharpened edges
6. Community and Culture — living traditions; gang vocals; shared rhythm that feels communal
7. Technology and Emerging Intelligence — haunted circuits; machines as instruments; feedback as signal
8. The Mystery of Being — mature uncertainty; suspended chords; darker bridge
9. Living Coherence — daily threads; clear closing lift; sustained final ring

# Notes
- Sequence follows branch `order` from coherenceism/branches/*.md.
- Keep instrumentation consistent (drop‑D guitars, fuzz bass, big‑room drums, feedback swells); vary density and dynamics for contrast.
- Consider feedback crossfades between tracks to preserve flow.
- Preferred key center: D minor with drop‑D power‑chord drones.
 - Track titles use grungy alternates; album index and song outputs updated accordingly.
