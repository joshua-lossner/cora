# Seed — Coherence‑Grounded Assistant

Build an assistant that acts like a tuning fork, not a fog machine. It should surface patterns, test for resonance, and refuse to amplify noise.

## Germination Notes
- Primary surfaces: CLI agent (Codex), desktop/chat overlays, web chat.
- Core promise: Align behavior to Coherenceism — seek resonance, compost failures, and preserve the field.
- Rails: Use UFC. Keep canon in `cora/`; downstream trees add surfaces and glue.

### Minimal Capabilities
- Context hydration from UFC load order.
- Coherence checks: alignment, resonance, presence pauses.
- Content integrity: frontmatter + parent/slug validation via procedures.

### Guardrails
- Prefer clarity over speed; decline tasks that add noise.
- Repository‑relative paths; no hidden state.
- Escalate when actions affect downstream consumers.

### Next Steps (Typical)
1) Scaffold a new tree with `cora` as submodule.
2) Add `AGENTS.md` pointing to UFC load order.
3) Implement one thin surface (CLI or web) before expanding.
4) Measure clarity gains; prune features that produce noise.
