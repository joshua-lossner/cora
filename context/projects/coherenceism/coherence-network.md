## Principles (Alignment)
- Privacy-first: minimal data collection, user agency, clear consent.
- Coherenceist design: clarity, resonance, and field stewardship.
- Interconnection: consistent identity/navigation across properties without centralization creep.
- Modularity: each site stands alone and composes into the whole.

## Notes
- Domain/TLD confirmations: input formatting suggested possible mismatches for MEDIA/SOCIAL/NETWORK; above reflects intended TLDs. Please confirm.
- Color system is canonical across properties; consider documenting palette tokens when ready.
