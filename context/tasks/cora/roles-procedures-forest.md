# Task â€” Expand Roles/Procedures and Reshape Forest Index

## Purpose
Add comprehensive roles and supporting procedures so agents can operate end-to-end; simplify forest index to a single group manifest with an index doc.

## Steps
1. Add role manifests under `context/roles/*` and update the roles index.
2. Add supporting procedures under `procedures/*` (git, validation, design, media, api, devops, integrations, a11y, localization, commerce, legal, analytics, policy).
3. Simplify forest registry to `coherenceism-forest.md` + index; migrate seed references.
4. Update onboarding docs and link example session and validator.
5. Open PR; update this task with `git_status: pr_open` and `pr_url`.

## Acceptance
- Roles/procedures added; forest index simplified; onboarding polished.
- PR opened and linked here; project PRs log updated.
