# Inspiration
Fatigue, misreads, and the choice to do nothing. Let stillness reset the meter.

# Style Prompt
Ambient downtempo ~78–82 BPM; sparse drums or brushed patterns, analog pads, fragile piano, intimate vocals. Theme: fatigue and the restorative choice to be still; chorus is a gentle release. [Intro: distant fireworks hush] [Break: train window finger count] Negatives: no big rises, no heavy compression, no aggressive leads.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Distant fireworks; room hush]

[Verse 1]
Miscount twice in the same aisle
Sleep slips off for a while
Rumors draft through an open door
I don’t believe them anymore

[Chorus]
I will do nothing, just this once
Let the river keep its fronts
Stillness sets the meter right
Smallest choice admits the light

[Verse 2]
Tiles on the window, finger misses one
World stays put, the train still runs
Blank line lengthens on the map I keep
Quiet earns the rest I need

[Bridge]
[Breath in four; let go]
Morning finds a steady glow

[Chorus]
I will do nothing, just this once
Let the river keep its fronts
Stillness sets the meter right
Smallest choice admits the light

[Outro]
[Soft pad fade; one piano note]
