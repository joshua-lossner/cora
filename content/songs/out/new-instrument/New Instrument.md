# Style Prompt
Contemporary smooth jazz at 84–92 BPM; human quartet core with tasteful coloration (subtle tape delay on vibes, soft shimmer on Rhodes). Instrumental; structure: Intro → Head A → Head B → Instrumental Break (vibes+Rhodes interplay) → Solo 2 (sax) → Head A → Outro; avoid aggressive drums, distortion, harsh synths, heavy EDM elements, and busy solos.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Soft shimmer; widen the room]

[Head A]
[Sax and guitar share the theme]

[Head B]
[Rhodes adds color; bass steady]

[Instrumental Break]
[Vibes + Rhodes interplay with light delay]

[Solo 2]
[Tenor sax — warm, centered]

[Head A]
[Theme returns; minimal adornment]

[Outro]
[Delay tails fade into hush]
