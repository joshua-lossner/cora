# Concept
Nine songs mirror the Coherenceism branch order, reframed through an 80s‑alternative lens: urban nights, rain on pavement, neon fog on wet glass. Voice is reflective but unsentimental; intimacy over spectacle. A recurring three‑note resonance motif (scale degrees 1–♭3–4, transposed per key) threads the record—introduced as a guitar arpeggio, resurfacing as a bass hook or synth figure, and resolving in a brighter tint on the closer. Mid‑tempo pulse (90–122 BPM); melancholy that moves.

# Tracklist
1. Carrier in the Sky — seeing the web we’re already in
2. The Long Fade — compost cycles; endings rearrange, nothing disappears
3. Angle into the Wind — position over force; don’t push—align
4. Library Without Rules — quiet attention changes the field
5. Clean Lines — choices that strengthen the field
6. Small Rituals — rituals we share keep a group alive
7. Warm Machines — technology as new instrument in the mind
8. Rooms of Air — live the question; mature uncertainty
9. Stitch the Noise — daily threads; tune the field

# Notes
- Keep era‑true drums (707/606/Linn layers) and plate/room verbs; avoid glossy modern sheen.
- Bass slightly forward; guitars chorus‑kissed; pads subtle.
- Reuse the 1–♭3–4 resonance motif across tracks; resolve in major tint on the closer.
- Apply structure variations per plan (see below) to keep flow varied.

# Inspiration

## Concept (seed notes)
Nine songs mirror the Coherenceism branch order, reframed through an 80s‑alternative lens: urban nights, rain on pavement, neon fog on wet glass. Voice is reflective but unsentimental; intimacy over spectacle. A recurring three‑note resonance motif (scale degrees 1–♭3–4) threads the record—introduced as a guitar arpeggio, resurfacing as a bass hook or synth figure, and resolving in a brighter tint on the closer. Mid‑tempo pulse (90–122 BPM); melancholy that moves.

## Sonic Palette
- Guitars: clean/chorused (CE‑2 vibe), subtle flange, occasional eBow; jangle meets shimmer.
- Synths: Juno‑/Prophet‑style pads, simple arps; tasteful DX‑bells.
- Rhythm: TR‑707/606/early LinnDrum programs layered with tight live kit; gated but tasteful snare.
- Bass: melodic, slightly chorus‑kissed; carries counter‑hooks.
- Production: plate/room verbs, slapback for depth, tape‑ish saturation; wide but not glossy.
- Negatives: no modern trap hats; no EDM risers/supersaws; no hyper‑compressed masters; no bright pop sheen.

## Vocal + Lyrical Lens
- Lead: baritone or androgynous, close‑mic’d, weary clarity; occasional doubled choruses.
- Themes: signal vs. noise, alignment vs. force, presence in cities; concrete images first, philosophy under the skin.
- Refrains: short, repeatable hooks; verses hold small scenes; one open‑question line per song.

## Album Arc (branch‑aligned)
1) Universal Mind → widen the frame.
2) Death/Change → compost cycles.
3) Alignment → position, not push.
4) Presence → quiet attention.
5) Ethics/Action → clean lines, sharp choices.
6) Community/Culture → shared rituals.
7) Tech/Emerging Intelligence → haunted circuits, new instrument.
8) Mystery of Being → suspend certainty.
9) Living Coherence → daily threads, earned lift.

## Working Track Concepts (titles • feel • seed)
1. Carrier in the Sky — 116 BPM, Em/Dorian; chorused arpeggio introduces the motif; 707 + live hats. Hook: “We’re already in it, already in tune.”
2. The Long Fade — 98 BPM, Am; tom‑led groove, linn gate; endings rearrange, nothing disappears. Bridge seed: “Ash to signal.”
3. Angle into the Wind — 122 BPM, Dm; motorik hats, jangle chorus opens without getting louder. Hook: “Don’t push—align.”
4. Library Without Rules — 90 BPM, Gm; sparse verse, roomy snare, bass melody; breath as count‑in.
5. Clean Lines — 118 BPM, F#m; sharper guitars, palm‑mute pulse; chorus resolves to major‑tint. Refrain: “Make the field stronger.”
6. Small Rituals — 110 BPM, C Mixolydian; gang‑response, claps + 606; warm pad. “We keep a city alive by what we repeat.”
7. Warm Machines — 114 BPM, Bm; glassy bell arp, guitar swells; feedback as texture. Hook: “New instrument, same mind.”
8. Rooms of Air — 96 BPM, Em; suspended chords, unresolved question; darker bridge.
9. Stitch the Noise — 120 BPM, D major/Dorian tint; brighter jangle; final ring with motif in major.

## Motifs, Harmony, BPM
- Motif: 1–♭3–4 (transpose per key); appear as arpeggio, bass figure, or pad tag; major‑tint on the closer.
- Harmony: minor/Aeolian core with Dorian lifts; occasional Mixolydian for communal tracks.
- BPM: 90–122; keep danceable melancholy; avoid extremes.

## Era/Scene (for vibe, not named‑artist refs)
- UK post‑punk/goth (1979–87), Manchester/Factory aesthetics, early synthpop minimalism, jangle/dream‑pop edges.

## Structure Variations Plan (seed)
- Add [Pre‑Chorus] to Tracks 3 and 9.
- Use [Instrumental Break]/[Guitar Solo] on Track 7.
- Double [Chorus] on Track 6 to emphasize communal lift.

# Notes (optional)

### Assumptions
- 9 tracks mapped 1:1 to Coherenceism branches; English vocals; Suno v5 for prototypes.
- Titles above are working; final selection/sequence will be confirmed during the workflow’s title step.

### Risks + Mitigations
- Too‑retro pastiche → focus on concrete scene writing; avoid caricature tones.
- Over‑reverb wash → define transients; anchor with kick + bass; keep verbs plate/room‑natural.
- Modern drift → 707/606, chorus tones, and era‑true processing keep it grounded.

### Operator Pointers
- After review, run `workflows/music/suno-create-album.md:1` → fill final titles/sequence → evolve and move via `procedures/media/evolve_and_move_album.md:1`.
