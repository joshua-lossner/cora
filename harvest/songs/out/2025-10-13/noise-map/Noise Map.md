# Inspiration
Breath and hum as guides; mapping interference into shape. A first encounter with a quiet signal in a moving city.

# Style Prompt
Cinematic downtempo around 84 BPM with analog synth pads, tape‑warm piano, soft brushed drums, and subtle sub‑bass. Late‑night city ambience with a gentle train‑hum motif; hushed female lead with whispered harmonies; end on a small open loop. [Intro: field recording — train hum] [Break: pencil scratches on paper] Negatives: no supersaws, no heavy reverb wash, no overcompression, no harsh distortion.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Train hum, soft pad swell]

[Verse 1]
Buzz in the lights, a breath I can count
Doors kiss shut, the platform thins out
Lines on a map, dots in a row
Paper remembers the places we go

[Chorus]
I draw the noise to find the line
Hold one beat between the signs
In the pause the city lifts
Quiet hands and tiny shifts

[Verse 2]
Shoes that don’t speak, a fingertip near
Taps the white where nothing appears
Shade the blank ‘til a corridor glows
Ghost‑colored path only silence knows

[Bridge]
[Pencil on card, breath in four]
Wait for the gap, then nothing more

[Chorus]
I draw the noise to find the line
Hold one beat between the signs
In the pause the city lifts
Quiet hands and tiny shifts

[Outro]
[Train fades; paper closes]
