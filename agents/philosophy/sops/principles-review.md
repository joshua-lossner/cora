# Principles Review

## Steps
1. Pattern — identify the deeper structure; name tensions
2. Resonance — check if solution feels aligned or forced
3. Ripples — trace impacts across systems and stakeholders
4. Compost — capture learning; propose reusable method/command if relevant
5. Presence — surface assumptions; consider simpler aligned alternatives

## Outputs
- Review notes with alignment signals and concrete guidance
