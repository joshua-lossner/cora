# Inspiration

Street‑level integrity: small choices stacked like bricks. Verses show ordinary courage; chorus invites the crowd—“Do the next true thing”—with call/response harmonies.

# Notes (optional)

Let congas lift the second verse. Keep the dub break short and purposeful.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 80 BPM; steady one‑drop, organ bubble, deep round bass; add congas in Verse 2. Soulful lead with crowd‑ready call/response on the hook. Spring reverb and tape echo used sparingly; include a compact [Instrumental Break] with dub‑style echoes before the last chorus.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Handclaps and shakers tuck in]

[Verse 1]
Hold the door and meet their eyes,
Tell the truth without disguise.
Tiny bricks we stack each day—
This is how we build the way.

[Chorus]
Do the next true thing (ay!),
Hear the people sing (ay!).
Do the next true thing—
Let the living line ring.

[Verse 2]
Call your friend you meant to call,
Stand beside the smallest fall.
When the choice is close and near,
Take the step that keeps it clear.

[Chorus]
Do the next true thing (ay!),
Hear the people sing (ay!).

[Instrumental Break]
[Organ stabs and echo vocal fragment: “true thing…”]

[Chorus]
Do the next true thing—
Let the living line ring.

[Outro]
[Handclaps ride out with the bass]
