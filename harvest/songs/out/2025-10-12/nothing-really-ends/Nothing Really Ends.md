# Inspiration

Compost cycles as rock & roll: endings fold into new verses. A sweet‑sorrow melody over a 12‑bar shuffle; sax steps out for a heartfelt solo before the final chorus.

# Style Prompt

12‑bar blues‑tinged 1950s rock & roll at ~150 BPM with shuffle drums, upright bass slap, clean guitar, piano comping, and a prominent tenor sax. Yearning lead vocal in English with gentle call‑and‑response; include a featured [Sax Solo] before the last chorus. Keep mono‑style space; exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Low piano rumble; guitar pickup]

[Verse 1]
Old sign faded on the edge of town,
We lost a light but the moon came round,
Pack up the pain, lay it in the ground,
Come springtime up pops a brand new sound.

[Chorus]
Nothing really ends, it just bends into a start,
Turn it like a record till it finds the heart,
Nothing really ends, hear the chorus make amends,
We sing it back together — nothing really ends.

[Verse 2]
Last dance over, but the feet still know,
There’s a road from here where the slow winds blow,
We plant a little melody and let it grow,
A second verse rising where the tears used to go.

[Sax Solo]
[Tenor sings the hook]

[Chorus]
Nothing really ends, it just bends into a start,
Turn it like a record till it finds the heart.

[Outro]
[Soft guitar and piano cadence]
