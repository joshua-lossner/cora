# Task â€” Establish Branching Strategy & Git Procedures

## Purpose
Adopt a clear, lightweight branching strategy (main + feature/bugfix + PRs) and document it in procedures for repeatable use.

## Steps
1. Add branching strategy doc and supporting git procedures.
2. Update Project Manager and QA/Release Manager roles to load the new procedures.
3. Create a feature branch for this change and push it.
4. Open a PR and set `git_status: pr_open` with `pr_url` in this task.

## Acceptance
- Procedures exist under `procedures/git/` and roles load them.
- Feature branch created and PR opened.
- This task updated with `git_status: pr_open` and `pr_url`.
