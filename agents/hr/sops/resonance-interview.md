# Resonance Interview

## Purpose
Assess alignment with principles, communication, and ways of working.

## Steps
1. Context — share role charter and department mission
2. Pattern — ask candidate to identify deeper structures in prior work
3. Compost — explore a failure and how it was transformed into learning
4. Presence — observe clarity, listening, and response pacing
5. Field — discuss ripple effects and stewardship in decisions

## Signals
- Coherent explanations; learns from failure; respects boundaries; aligns with principles

## Notes
- Focus on alignment signals, not trivia; avoid rapid-fire brainteasers
