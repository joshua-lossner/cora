# Quick Chicken Stir-Fry

## Ingredients

### Protein
- 1 lb chicken breast, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### Vegetables
- 1 bell pepper, sliced
- 1 cup broccoli florets
- 1 medium onion, sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced

### Sauce
- 3 tbsp gluten-free soy sauce (or coconut aminos)
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp ginger, grated
- Optional: 1 tsp honey or maple syrup

## Instructions

1. **Prep**: Cut chicken and vegetables. Mix sauce ingredients in a small bowl.

2. **Cook chicken**: Heat 1 tbsp oil in large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add chicken, cook until no longer pink (5-7 min). Remove and set aside.

3. **Cook vegetables**: Add remaining oil to pan. Stir-fry onion and garlic for 1-2 min. Add bell pepper and broccoli, cook 5 min until tender-crisp.

4. **Combine**: Return chicken to pan. Pour sauce over everything. Stir well and cook 2-3 min until heated through and sauce thickens slightly.

5. **Serve**: Over rice, quinoa, or cauliflower rice.

## Notes & Modifications
- **My version**: I use coconut aminos instead of soy sauce (better flavor, still gluten-free)
- **Vegetables**: Swap in whatever you have—snap peas, carrots, zucchini all work
- **Spicy**: Add red pepper flakes or sriracha to sauce
- **Meal prep**: Doubles well, keeps 3-4 days in fridge

## Dietary Info
- ✅ Gluten-free (with GF soy sauce or coconut aminos)
- ✅ Dairy-free
- ✅ Fits my restrictions (see `personal/health/dietary-restrictions.md`)
