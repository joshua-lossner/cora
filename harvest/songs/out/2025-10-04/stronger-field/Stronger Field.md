# Lyrics
[Title: "Stronger Field"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~102 BPM]
[Chord Progression: tight verse riff → wide open chorus]

[Intro]
[Tight drum fill into riff; bass locked.]

[Verse 1]
Not every road that shines is right,
Some lines bend under borrowed light,
Choose what thickens, what can stand,
Let your weight be in your hands.

[Chorus]
Make the stronger field, not noise,
Signal over sharper toys,
Make the stronger field and see,
What we hold becomes what we’ll be.

[Verse 2]
Cheap applause fades fast and thin,
Clarity cuts cleaner skin,
Do the small thing all the way,
Right now is how we build the day.

[Bridge]
[Break — tambourine hits; guitar feedback swells.]
Turn the screw until it’s true.

[Chorus]
Make the stronger field, not noise,
Signal over sharper toys,
Make the stronger field and see,
What we hold becomes what we’ll be.

[Outro]
[Final chord choked; drum flam.]
