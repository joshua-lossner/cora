AGENTS.md is the canonical entrypoint for cora. Use it for load order, checklist, confirmations, and indexes.

- Read: `AGENTS.md`
- Notes: prefer repoâ€‘relative paths; set local absolutes in `.env` if needed
- Compatibility: this file remains to support older workflows that expect `AGENT_STARTUP.md`
