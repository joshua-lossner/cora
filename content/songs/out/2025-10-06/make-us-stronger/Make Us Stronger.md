# Inspiration
Ethics as field‑strength: clean lines, steady vows. Punchy pre‑chorus into a big harmony chorus declaring “make the field stronger.”

# Notes (optional)
Add octave jumps in bass on chorus 2; pad widens the stereo field.

# Style Prompt
Modern boy‑band arena‑pop at 118 BPM. Palm‑mute guitars + pop drums, pad lift in choruses, side‑chained sub‑bass, strong harmony stack. Pre‑Chorus punch into big vow Chorus: “make us stronger.” No harsh distortion; no heavy EDM drops.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Palm‑mute guitar; claps]

[Verse 1]
Late shift, long road, we’re drawing a line,
Cutting through static with something fine.
One true thing we can hold tonight—
It’s enough to get it right.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Clear the blur and keep the tone,
I won’t let you stand alone.

[Chorus]
Make us stronger,
Make the field ring true.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

[Verse 2]
We don’t need louder, just better placed,
Hands on the wheel, not a frantic chase.
Every small vow is a brighter fuse—
Lighting the path we choose.

[Bridge]
[Guitars sharpen; pad widens]
If we keep our promise steady,
The world will meet us ready.

[Chorus]
Make us stronger,
Make the field ring true.
Draw the clean lines—
I’ll hold them with you.

[Post‑Chorus]
Oh‑oh, we get stronger—me and you.

[Outro]
[Claps and pad; soft ad‑libs]
