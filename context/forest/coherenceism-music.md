# coherenceism.music

## Orientation
- Purpose: Translate coherence practices into soundscapes and participatory audio experiences.
- Surfaces: playlists, guided audio practices, live session recordings.
- Branch Structure: genres as branches (drone, folk, ambient) with leaves for releases and sessions.

## Lineage
- Seeds: `edge-of-knowing`, `personal-compost-pile`.
- Dependencies: CORA trunk (submodule), audio production workflows.

## Next Change
- Draft initial playlist concepts aligned to each branch and identify collaborators.
