(## Introduction) Tj
T*
(The second cookie, the midnight scroll, the tab left open like a wound.) Tj
T*
T*
(Comfort delays pain; coherence dissolves it. One hides the wound; the other lets it heal.) Tj
T*
T*
(_For knowledge workers burned by hustle culture; choose coherence over comfort._) Tj
T*
T*
(## Core) Tj
T*
T*
(• Opening image: The second cookie, the midnight scroll, the tab left open like a wound.) Tj
T*
(Comfort numbs; the problem waits.) Tj
T*
(• Thesis: Comfort delays pain; coherence dissolves it. Coherence is the capacity to stay) Tj
T*
(aligned while conditions move.) Tj
T*
(• Why now: Everyone is tired. Hustle culture broke the meter; "self-care" became another) Tj
T*
(productivity hack.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Cases) Tj
T*
(• Projects stall where roles are unclear \(I\); team avoids naming the knot.) Tj
T*
(• Boundaries voiced reduce rework by ~20% \(U\); find supporting study or downgrade.) Tj
T*
(• Presence beats backlog triage for next move \(I\).) Tj
T*
T*
(## Practical Moves) Tj
T*
(• Sunday night audit: list 5 comfort loops; pick 1 to swap for a coherent move this week.) Tj
T*
(• One-breath reset before big sends; state the pattern you serve \(not the fear you avoid\).) Tj
T*
(• 150 minutes/week light exercise improves mood and clarity \(F\) — find WHO guidance.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Relationships) Tj
T*
(• The knot you carry after ducking a hard talk; the breath you get back when a boundary) Tj
T*
(is voiced.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Money / Numbers) Tj
T*
(• Numeric example: 5% APR on $1,000 with monthly compounding for 1 year ≈ $51.16 interest) Tj
T*
(\(F\) — show math; cite CFPB explainer on compound interest.) Tj
T*
T*
(## Ending) Tj
T*
(• Forward-looking line: choose the next small, daily move toward coherence. Not bigger.) Tj
T*
