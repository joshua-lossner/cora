# Notes
- Boundary as care: saying yes to what you can carry.
- Micro-scene: the knot you carry after ducking the talk vs breath when voiced.
- Work: team agrees to office hours; fewer pings â†’ better focus.
- Home: one check-in each evening; fewer resentments, clearer plans.
- Practical moves: name one boundary; script the line; set review date.
- Counterpoint: be flexible during emergencies; return to baseline after.
