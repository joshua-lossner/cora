# Inspiration

Ethics in motion — choosing proportioned moves when pressure hits. Hooks punch with a short maxim (“carry the right weight”). Verses use concrete choices (when to swing, when to stand) over moralizing.

# Style Prompt

1990s boom‑bap at 92 BPM; mood assertive/reflective; jazz‑soul chops with horn stabs; punchy kick+snare; filtered bass. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Outro; concise, maxim‑style hook. Vocals: crisp consonants, internal rhymes, grounded specifics. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy risers, heavy autotune; vocal upfront; dynamic master.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Horn stab; snare crack]

[Verse 1]
Not every fight is righteous, not every silence weak,
Balance isn’t cowardice; it’s math in how we speak.
Carry what you’re built for, set the rest down on the curb,
Integrity is action, not a slogan or a word.
When a friend needs space, I make it; when a line gets crossed, I say it,
I don’t flex for decoration; keep my compass where I lay it.
Right weight is how you move when eyes are off the stage —
You do small honest things, and that’s a lifetime paid.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Verse 2]
I’ve seen loud men crumble when the check arrives at last,
All that thunder in their talking, but their numbers bleed the past.
I’ve watched quiet women anchor whole communities by hand,
No announcements, just decisions that keep rhythm in the band.
If I’m tempted by the spectacle, I ground it in a task —
Call my mother, sweep my doorway, write the truth and take the mask.
When the easy road is crooked, I will walk the slower street —
If my shoes fit what I’m claiming, then my rhymes won’t have to cheat.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Verse 3]
Some nights I want the credit; let me name it, let it pass,
Being honest with the craving is how craving doesn’t last.
I return to what is mine — keep my corner swept and clean,
Do not amplify the chaos; tune the drum behind the scene.
If I’m trusted with a lever, I will pull it with a care —
Right proportion is the ethic; any more would be a tear.
In the end, the chorus measures what you carried, not your fame —
Did you shoulder what was yours? If yes, the rest can change.

[Chorus]
Carry the right weight — step with the right rate,
Move like the truth moves, steady through the bright days.
Carry the right weight — you don’t need a wide gate,
Just enough for one step, done in the right way.

[Outro]
[Horn tail; vinyl hiss]
