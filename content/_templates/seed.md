# Seed — Example Project Starter

Describe the downstream system this seed proposes (purpose, audience, core promise). Clarify why this belongs as a separate tree instead of a leaf.

## Germination Notes
- Scope: the surfaces or mediums the downstream tree will operate in.
- Seed stage: `idea | incubating | germinated | retired`.
- Spawned systems: list slugs that map to `coherenceism/forest/` entries.

Keep this concise. Implementation, UI, and publishing live in the downstream tree; this seed only orients and tracks lineage.
