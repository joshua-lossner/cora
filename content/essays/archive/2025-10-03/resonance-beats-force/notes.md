# Notes
- Force creates brittle systems; resonance reduces friction and invites adoption.
- Examples: API design that follows existing mental models vs forcing new patterns.
- Practical: align names, defaults, and boundaries with user expectations; less glue code.
- Counterpoint: short-term force helpful in emergencies; keep it local and reversible.
- Structure: define resonance vs force; cases (APIs, teams, habits); moves; ending.
