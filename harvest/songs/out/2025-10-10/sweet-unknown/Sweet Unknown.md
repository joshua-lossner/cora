# Inspiration

Mystery not as fear but flavor. Verses name the hush before dawn and the moment a crowd goes quiet together. Nyabinghi hand‑drum interlude enters like a heartbeat under the chorus—“Sweet unknown, steady light.”

# Notes (optional)

Variation: add [Nyabinghi Interlude] after Verse 2. Keep hand drums soft and round; no flashy fills.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 74 BPM; airy one‑drop, organ bubble, mellow horns; add a soft [Bridge] with hand drums after Verse 2 and a brief [Instrumental Break] with dub‑style echoes before the final chorus. Warm, meditative lead; stacked harmonies on the hook. Keep echoes subtle.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Shakers, organ pad; melodica breath]

[Verse 1]
Before the dawn has learned to speak,
Silver sky on every cheek.
Quiet roads and gentle tone—
Walk with me in the unknown.

[Chorus]
Sweet unknown, steady light,
Hold me kindly through the night.
Sweet unknown, steady light—
Meet me where the stars are bright.

[Verse 2]
Crowd goes quiet, hearts align,
Every voice on the same time.
When the moment opens wide,
Let the little self subside.

[Bridge]
[Hand drums and hum; heartbeat pulse]

[Chorus]
Sweet unknown, steady light,
Hold me kindly through the night.

[Instrumental Break]
[Soft echoes circle the last line]

[Chorus]
Sweet unknown, steady light—
Meet me where the stars are bright.

[Outro]
[Melodica holds the tonic]
