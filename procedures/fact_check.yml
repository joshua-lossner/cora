kind: procedure
id: fact_check
version: 0.4
purpose: "Verify claims and references; ensure citations resolve; mark assumptions explicitly."
inputs:
  required:
    - draft.md
  optional:
    - sources[]      # list of candidate sources (URLs or local refs)
    - context.refs[]
outputs:
  - citations.md
  - fact_check_report.md
  - draft_checked.md
agents:
  actor: s_vektor
constraints:
  - "No invented citations; if evidence lacks, mark as assumption or remove."
  - "Prefer primary sources; grade evidence E1..E4."
  - "Keep a one-to-one map from in-text claims to references or assumption flags."
  - "Include at least one worked numeric example in the Money/Interest section; verify arithmetic and cite a reputable source (e.g., CFPB)."
  - "Citations style: footnotes-first in final; minimize in-text authority phrases; allow at most one conversational nod (e.g., 'research showsâ€¦')."
eval_checks:
  - "All (F) facts have supporting sources or are downgraded to (I/U)."
  - "References resolve and match quoted/paraphrased content."
  - "Report lists unknowns (U) with acquisition plan."
  - "Money section contains a numeric, worked example; math is internally consistent and source-supported."
  - "Final uses footnotes for citations; in-text authority mentions <= 1."
failure_modes:
  - code: DEAD_LINKS
    remedy: "Find archived copies or alternative primary sources; update citations."
  - code: SOURCE_MISMATCH
    remedy: "Correct paraphrase/quote or replace source."
  - code: EVIDENCE_GAP
    remedy: "Propose 3 candidate sources or tests; mark as assumption meanwhile."
  - code: NO_WORKED_EXAMPLE
    remedy: "Add a small, verifiable numeric example in the Money section (interest, payoff horizon) with a reputable source; otherwise remove the claim or downgrade."
  - code: PAMPHLET_TONE
    remedy: "Move authority phrases out of the prose; keep citations as footnotes and let the narrative carry the weight."

# Notes (human/agent)

- If no credible source exists, the honest label is (U), not spin.
- Prefer methods and data over punditry; downgrade accordingly.
