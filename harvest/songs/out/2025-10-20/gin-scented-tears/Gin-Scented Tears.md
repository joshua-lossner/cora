# Inspiration

The café, late afternoon. Liquid burns the throat but doesn't warm. Sitting alone at the marble table, tears tracking down—not from sorrow, but from something broken beyond feeling. Synths drone without variation. Drum machines drag. The surveillance ping is just background noise now, as natural as breathing. Tracing patterns on the table and feeling nothing.

# Style Prompt

Industrial post-punk at 80 BPM, slowed and defeated; cold analog synth drones without variation, slowed heavy bass, mechanical drum machines dragging with defeated energy, sparse mournful but cold strings, constant static hum. Male baritone completely drained of emotion—hollow, broken delivery. No dynamic variation—flat emotional landscape throughout. Surveillance "ping" normalized and unnoticed. No warmth, energy, or hope remaining. Pure numbness and empty acceptance.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Slow dragging drums; emotionless synth drone]

[Verse 1]
The café chair, the marble stain,
The glass refilled, the burning taste.
Tears fall down but nothing hurts—
The feeling's gone, the self's erased.

[Chorus]
Gin-scented tears on hollow cheeks,
I trace the answer: two plus two.
The person that I was is dead—
What's left accepts it all as true.

[Verse 2]
The screen above shows his face,
I don't look away, I don't resist.
The melody plays on repeat—
A lullaby for the abyss.

[Bridge]
[Flat, emotionless delivery]
The melody loops endlessly,
A rhythm without memory—
But nothing registers as loss,
Just static where the heart should be.

[Chorus]
Gin-scented tears on hollow cheeks,
I trace the answer: two plus two.
The person that I was is dead—
What's left accepts it all as true.

[Outro]
[Drums drag to near-stop; sustained synth drone]
