# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Light ride, airy Rhodes; set the flow]

[Head A]
[Clean guitar melody, unhurried]

[Head B]
[Guitar and sax in gentle dialogue]

[Solo 1]
[Tenor sax — lean into the wave]

[Solo 2]
[Guitar — singing tone, short chorus]

[Head A]
[Return to melody; breathe]

[Outro]
[Ride whispers; Rhodes closes softly]
