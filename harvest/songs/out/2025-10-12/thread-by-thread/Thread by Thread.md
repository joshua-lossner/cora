# Inspiration

Living coherence as small, steady stitches: each verse adds a line to the pattern, chorus lifts the room. Instrumental break lets piano quote the three‑note hook while guitar answers.

# Style Prompt

1950s rock & roll, ~150 BPM straight‑eighths with handclaps, boogie‑woogie piano quoting a three‑note motif, clean twang guitar, upright bass, and ride kit. Open, friendly lead with supportive BGVs in English; include an [Instrumental Break] trading lines between piano and guitar. Exclude modern trap/EDM, autotune, and contemporary synths.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Claps on two and four; piano lick quotes motif]

[Verse 1]
One stitch, two stitch, keep it tight,
Little wins working through the night,
Patch that tear with a steady light,
Small hands weaving till it feels just right.

[Chorus]
Thread by thread we make it true,
Thread by thread with me and you,
Hold the line and pull it through,
Thread by thread, the pattern grew.

[Verse 2]
Pick it up when a friend falls down,
Share your song, give back the crown,
Tiny notes turn a whole room round,
Find the chord where the hearts get found.

[Instrumental Break]
[Piano answers guitar; trade 4s]

[Chorus]
Thread by thread we make it true,
Thread by thread with me and you.

[Outro]
[Short piano tag]
