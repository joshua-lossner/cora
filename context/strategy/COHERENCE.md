# COHERENCE — Strategy

## Purpose
Provide a shared, non-personal strategic stack for the Coherenceism network: challenges we address, programs we run, objectives we target, and metrics we track.

## Load
Open this index during planning, prioritization, and reviews. Link programs and objectives to active trees in `context/forest/` and current work in `context/working/active/`.

## Structure
- challenges.md — Strategic challenges (formerly TELOS problems)
- programs.md — Programs responding to challenges (formerly TELOS missions)
- objectives.md — Time-bound objectives (formerly TELOS goals)
- metrics.md — Measurements and cadence (formerly TELOS metrics)

## Notes
- This replaces personal TELOS framing with network-oriented strategy.
- Keep sensitive data out of these files; link to private dashboards if needed.
