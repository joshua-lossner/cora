# Notes: One Breath Reset

- Physiology: long exhale engages parasympathetic; reduces arousal.
- Practice: in through nose 4, out 6â€“8; feel belly/feet.
- Use cases: between meetings, after conflict, bedtime.
- Counterpoint: not a cure-all; if triggered hard, step away, move body.
- Structure: define, mechanisms, micro-scenes, practical moves.
