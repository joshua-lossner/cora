# Inspiration

Two plus two equals five. The Ministry's contradictions loop endlessly until they become true. Synths clash in dissonant harmony. Drum machines stutter and lose the beat. Propaganda broadcasts layer over each other—competing truths, all equally false. The voice is hollow, accepting the impossible. Memory dissolves. The surveillance ping continues, now just another piece of the accepted reality.

# Style Prompt

Industrial post-punk at 95 BPM with dissonance and disorientation; cold analog synths clashing in dissonant harmony, grinding bass, drum machines stuttering off-kilter (lose the beat intentionally). Layer propaganda broadcast samples with contradictory statements. Male baritone hollow and confused, mechanically accepting impossibilities. Sparse dissonant strings. Add spoken-word propaganda in Intro and Outro. No harmonic resolution—end on dissonance. Surveillance "ping" normalized, no longer threatening. Create cognitive fracture through sound.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Layered propaganda broadcasts: contradictory statements blur together]

[Verse 1]
The screen says two and two makes five,
I write it down, I know it's true.
Yesterday was never real—
The memory fades on cue.

[Chorus]
War is peace, and peace is war,
Freedom's just another chain.
The past is gone, the future's set—
I've learned to love the pain.

[Verse 2]
They say the chocolate ration's up,
Though less arrives each day.
The enemy was always them,
Or maybe it's the other way.

[Bridge]
[Multiple vocal tracks, contradictory lyrics simultaneously]
We've always been at war with them—
We've never been at war with them—
The truth is what they say it is—

[Chorus]
War is peace, and peace is war,
Freedom's just another chain.
The past is gone, the future's set—
I've learned to love the pain.

[Outro]
[Propaganda broadcasts intensify, then cut to silence]
[Dissonant drone sustains]
