# Projects Index

List of projects and guidance for what to load at startup.

## Startup Guidance

- Then open matching files in `context/working/active/` for current focus.
- Reference projects provide background; load as needed.

## Available Projects

- coherenceism/README.md — Reference — Philosophical and brand foundation; see `context/philosophy/coherenceism.md`
- coherenceism/coherence-network.md — Active — Privacy-first network of websites manifesting Coherenceism (MEDIA, INFO, AI, BLOG, SOCIAL, NETWORK, COM)

## Notes
- Add new projects as a single markdown file or a folder with a `README.md`.
- Update this index when adding or renaming projects.
- Templates: see `context/_templates/project.md`; example: `context/projects/_example.md`.
