# Inspiration
Daily threads that hold. Pre‑chorus leans forward; chorus resolves the resonance motif in a brighter tint. Final ring stays a few seconds longer than feels safe.

# Notes (optional)
Let bass climb into the last chorus; avoid over‑stacking guitars—use space for lift.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 120 BPM; bright jangle guitar and major‑tint pad, tight kit, melodic bass forward; baritone close‑mic’d vocals. Include [Pre‑Chorus] lift; chorus resolves the 1–♭3–4 motif in a brighter tint. Plate/room verbs; no modern trap hats/EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 8s]
[Jangle guitar; bass climbs]

[Verse 1]
Morning thread through keys and doors,
Habit hum beneath the floors.
Carry what the night misplaced—
Sew it back with patient grace.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Lean ahead, the measure’s poised,
Find the signal in the noise.

[Chorus]
Stitch the noise,
Line by line.
Hold the tone,
Let it shine.

[Verse 2]
Crosswalk’s tiny metronome,
Footsteps keep a kind of home.
Leave some space for what arrives—
Hear the daylight turn alive.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Lean ahead, the measure’s poised,
Find the signal in the noise.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Bass climbs; guitars answer]

[Bridge]
[Bass climbs; drums drop to rim]
All we keep is what we tend,
Thread by thread to the end.

[Chorus]
Stitch the noise,
Line by line.
Hold the tone,
Let it shine.

[Chorus]
Stitch the noise,
Line by line.
Hold the tone,
Let it shine.

[Outro]
[Final ring; motif resolves brighter]
