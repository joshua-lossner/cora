# Primer — Coherenceism

Coherenceism views reality as an interconnected field where truth emerges from resonance, not dominance. Systems align when their parts reduce distortion for the whole.

Use this primer to anchor site-specific introductions. Sites may add local overlays (e.g., musician-facing framing on MEDIA; research notes on INFO).
