# Style Prompt
Grunge, mid‑tempo, with decay textures: feedback swells as dissolve cues; verses uneasy and low, bridge drops to near‑silence, chorus resolves with the held‑note motif. Male gritty vocals, doubled chorus; room‑heavy drums; no pop gloss, no EDM hats, no synth leads, no auto‑tune.

# Lyrics
[Title: "Nothing Disappears"]
[Language: English]
[Key: D minor]
[Tempo: ~98 BPM]
[Chord Progression: drop‑D drones with descending verse figure]

[Intro]
[Feedback bloom; toms pulse like a slow heart.]

[Verse 1]
Rust‑red sky on a winter wire,
Ash of yesterday, slow fire,
Names we wore fall off in rain,
What we keep is what remains.

[Chorus]
Nothing disappears, it turns,
Compost heat where the old world burns,
Hold the note and let it be,
Death, change, reality.

[Verse 2]
Cracks in paint trace living veins,
Static clears and truth remains,
Lay it down, don’t clutch the seam,
Everything returns to stream.

[Bridge]
[Guitars mute; bass and breath, almost silent.]
One faint tone, a thread in the dark,
Then drums come in and strike the spark.

[Chorus]
Nothing disappears, it turns,
Compost heat where the old world burns,
Hold the note and let it be,
Death, change, reality.

[Outro]
[D drone sustains; decay rings long.]
