# Inspiration

Tuning the instrument you live in. Verse scenes show thought, action, being snapping into place — when you’re aligned, the beat carries you. Hook repeats a short phrase like a mantra; Rhodes stab is the motif that returns across the album.

# Style Prompt

1990s boom‑bap at 94 BPM; mood focused and confident; chopped jazz/soul loop with Rhodes stabs, punchy kick+snare, filtered bass, light horn accents. Structure: Intro → 3 x Verse/Chorus → Outro; mantra‑style hook. Vocals: gritty, internal multisyllables, tight pocket. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, 808‑dominant subs, glossy EDM risers, heavy autotune; mix vocal‑forward with drum punch, dynamic master.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Staccato Rhodes stab; rimshot count‑in]

[Verse 1]
I don’t muscle past the moment, I adjust and find the line,
When the metronome is honest, all the choices fall in time.
Every habit that was heavy gets recut into a groove,
I remove what keeps me static so the rest is free to move.
When attention is a lens, I keep it clear of greasy thumbprints,
Do the work before the work — that’s how the record earns its drum print.
I’m the instrument I tune, not a crown I have to chase,
Let the swing do what it does and keep my ego out the bass.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Verse 2]
I used to write like sirens, always fighting every bar,
Till I learned to hear the pattern that was driving every car.
Now I lift when lifting’s needed and I lean when leaning helps,
Not a statue in the traffic, I’m a dancer with myself.
Let the pocket be the teacher, let the silence set the scene,
When you trust what’s already working, force falls out of every scheme.
Take the lesson from the record: little hiss, a little grit —
Still the truth comes through the needle; you can feel the center hit.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Verse 3]
If I’m asking where to start, I start exactly where I stand,
Bring my breath back to its measure, keep my timing in my hand.
What I can’t control, I honor; what I can, I make precise,
Then I step like it’s a record — drop the needle, roll the dice.
When the chorus hits again, it isn’t hype, it’s day to day,
All the small alignments stacking; that’s the only honest way.
If the current’s moving steady, I don’t swim against the set,
I just angle for the ferry, let the river do the rest.

[Chorus]
In tune — let the rhythm carry you,
In tune — keep it simple, keep it true.
In tune — mind, action, being too,
In tune — every bar a clearer view.

[Outro]
[Rhodes tail; needle crackle]
