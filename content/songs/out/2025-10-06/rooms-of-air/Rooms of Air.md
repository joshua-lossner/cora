# Inspiration
Precision and wonder held together; ask the question and let it ring. Verses walk quiet streets; the bridge darkens, then returns to air.

# Notes (optional)
Keep vocal close and dry in verses; add plate length on choruses for lift.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 96 BPM; suspended‑chord clean guitars, soft pad, restrained kit, melodic bass; baritone close‑mic’d vocal. Mood: mature uncertainty and wonder. Plate verbs for choruses only; exclude modern trap hats/EDM risers/supersaws.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 8s]
[Suspended chords; hush]

[Verse 1]
Midnight hallways, breath held thin,
Streetlight dust just floating in.
Name it softly if you dare—
It moves, and leaves a room of air.

[Chorus]
Hold the question,
Don’t decide.
Let it open—
We’ll step inside.

[Verse 2]
Keys on marble, careful feet,
Windows count the city’s beat.
Every answer needs a pair—
One to doubt and one to care.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Guitars and pad hold; bass steps forward]

[Bridge]
[Darker pad, lower bass]
What if mystery is precise,
And certainty the smaller vice?

[Chorus]
Hold the question,
Don’t decide.
Let it open—
We’ll step inside.

[Chorus]
Hold the question,
Don’t decide.
Let it open—
We’ll step inside.

[Outro]
[Guitars ring; plate tails]
