# Inspiration

Daily threads that hold. Keep the sound consistent but let the last chorus lift just a little brighter, then end on a sustained ring — the living line remains. The refrain echoes once more: we are the wire.

# Notes (optional)

- Consider a short hidden ring after silence, as a nod back to Track 1.
- Variation: add a double [Chorus] ending before [Outro].
