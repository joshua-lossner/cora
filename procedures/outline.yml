kind: procedure
id: outline
version: 0.4
purpose: "Produce a minimal, testable outline from notes + intent, labeling claims as fact/inference/unknown."
inputs:
  required:
    - notes.md
    - intent.yml   # fields: thesis, audience, stance, length_minutes, (optional tone, sources[])
  optional:
    - context.refs[]
outputs:
  - outline.md
  - claim_table.csv
  - assumptions.md
agents:
  actor: s_vektor
constraints:
  - "Thesis must be a single sentence."
  - "Every paragraph topic must map to a labeled claim (F/I/U)."
  - "Prefer the smallest structure that can hold the argument."
  - "Propose a concrete opening hook (image or micro-scene) and a forward-looking closing line."
  - "Propose a relationships micro-scene (the knot or boundary voiced) to avoid thin treatment."
eval_checks:
  - "Outline has <= 7 top-level sections (incl. intro/outro)."
  - "Each section ties to the thesis or removes itself."
  - "Claim table present with columns: id, section, type(F/I/U), statement, evidence, risk."
  - "Hook candidate present near the top; closing line suggests forward motion."
  - "Relationships section includes a candidate image or micro-scene."
failure_modes:
  - code: NO_THESIS
    remedy: "Derive a candidate from notes; present 1–3 options and request confirmation."
  - code: OVERFIT
    remedy: "Merge or drop sections that duplicate the same claim."
  - code: THIN_EVIDENCE
    remedy: "Flag as I/U; propose 3 discriminating sources or tests."

      description: "List 1–3 concrete opening images or micro-scenes that embody the thesis."

    - id: relationships_scene
      description: "Draft a 1–2 sentence image or micro-scene for the Relationships section (the knot carried; boundary voiced)."

    - id: section_map
      description: "Create 4–6 body sections + intro/outro that trace the thesis."
      outputs: [sections.yml]

    # Title: {{ title or 'TBD' }}
    **Thesis:** {{ thesis }}
    **Audience:** {{ audience }}
    **Stance:** {{ stance }}
    **Tone:** {{ tone or 'neutral' }}

    ### Hook Candidates (images/micro-scenes)
    - Note 1–3 vivid openings that show the problem before we name it.

    ### Relationships Micro-scene (avoid thin treatment)
    - Draft 1–2 sentences (the knot carried; boundary voiced; breath returned).

    ## Introduction
    - Setup: why this matters now
    - Preview: 3 moves you’ll make

    {% for s in sections %}
    ## {{ s.title }}
    - Purpose: {{ s.purpose }}
    - Claims:
    {% for c in s.claims %}
      - ({{ c.type }}) {{ c.statement }}
        - Evidence: {{ c.evidence or 'TBD' }}
        - Risk: {{ c.risk or 'low' }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}

    ## Conclusion
    - Return to thesis; state what changes
    - Forward-looking line (small, daily choice); Next actions / questions

# Notes (human/agent)

- Keep the outline short; the essay will expand it.
- If sections drift, ask for a tighter thesis or reduce scope.
- Label boldly; ambiguity now is cheaper than revision later.
