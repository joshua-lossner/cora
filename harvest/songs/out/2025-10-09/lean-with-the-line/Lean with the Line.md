# Inspiration
Work song for alignment. Verse images: kites riding wind, boats angling into the current, a shoulder leaning with the weight just right. Pre‑Chorus names the temptation to push; Chorus answers with a simple practice: lean with the line.

# Notes (optional)
Hook: “Don’t push—lean with the line.”

# Style Prompt
1970s country‑soul groove at 86 BPM; clean tremolo guitar, Wurli, Hammond pad, warm bass, laid‑back drums with tambourine; upbeat baritone and light gospel BGVs. Include [Pre‑Chorus] lift and double [Chorus]; keep pocket relaxed. No heavy distortion, EDM hats, auto‑tune, or hyper‑compression.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Tambourine shake; guitar sets pocket]

[Verse 1]
Kite line humming, find the hold,
Lean into the living fold.
Boat comes round to meet the tide,
Hands know where the weight will ride.

[Pre‑Chorus]
Every time I try to force,
I lose the easy flow of course.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—lean with the line,
Let the current carry time.

[Verse 2]
Wind through wires, a steady tone,
Shoulder sets and isn’t stone.
Turn your effort just a hair,
Feel the whole world do its share.

[Bridge]
[Organ lifts; BGVs answer]
Power isn’t in the strain,
It’s in the way you meet the grain.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—lean with the line,
Let the current carry time.

[Chorus]
Don’t push—lean with the line,
Let the current carry time.

[Outro]
[Guitar tag; resonance motif]
