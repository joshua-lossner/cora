# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Soft Rhodes figure with descending changes]

[Head A]
[Sax carries a calm, accepting melody]

[Head B]
[Flugelhorn shades the theme; Rhodes supports]

[Solo 1]
[Tenor sax — short phrases, kind tone]

[Solo 2]
[Flugelhorn — breathy, low dynamics]

[Head A]
[Return; bass ostinato circles back]

[Outro]
[Warm fade; gentle tambourine acceptable if tucked]
