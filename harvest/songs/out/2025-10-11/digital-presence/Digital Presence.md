# Inspiration

Tools and AI as a new instrument in the same mind — discipline online, presence in the feed. Verses paint hands‑on rigor (no doomscroll drift); bridge reframes attention as design. Slight G‑funk color for lift; end with an extended chorus.

# Style Prompt

’90s boom‑bap at 98 BPM with subtle West Coast G‑funk color; focused, grounded mood; punchy kick+snare, filtered bass, Rhodes stabs, occasional synth bass glide; chant‑ready extended chorus. Structure: Intro → Verse/Chorus → Verse/Chorus → Bridge → Double Chorus → Outro. Vocals: precise internal multisyllables; assertive but calm. Negatives: avoid modern trap hats, overpowering 808s, glossy EDM risers, heavy autotune; vocal‑forward, dynamic master.

# Lyrics

[Intro]
[Modem‑like sweep; needle crackle returns]

[Verse 1]
Thumb scroll learns my rhythm if I give it all my hours,
So I ration what I feed it; I retain my choosing powers.
Turn the phone into a tool, not a tractor for my mind,
Close the tabs like closing loops; leave the noise and keep the finds.
If the algorithm begs me with a sugar‑rush of light,
I exhale, set a timer, write a verse, and set it right.
Presence is a practice like a chorus you repeat —
Every time I want to wander, I return to hands and feet.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Verse 2]
I log out when I’m working so my focus has a room,
If the chat becomes a furnace, I don’t feed it any fumes.
Every message isn’t urgent; every ping is not a drum,
Some are wind against a window; some deserve a metronome.
Build a daily little scaffold: when to open, when to close,
Make a ritual of posting so your energy can grow.
I’m not hostile to the network; I just play it like a bass —
Right hand dampens what is fake; left hand walks a grounded pace.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Bridge]
Design is care in motion — choose proportions for your day,
Let the tools support attention, not the other kind of way.
Set the thresholds, mark transitions; keep your circles living well,
Then the chorus is a promise you can actually tell.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Chorus]
Stay present online — let the mind be the design,
Not a puppet to the timeline or a puppet to the sign.
Stay present online — let your breath set the align,
Put the signal over static; make your scrolling into time.

[Outro]
[Synth glide tails; record click]
