# Practice — The Personal Compost Pile

This week, choose one belief, habit, or project that no longer serves you.

- Write what it once gave you — the nutrients.
- Write what it costs you now — the toxins.
- Release it so its best parts feed something else.

Do this enough, and fear of endings becomes skill at transformation.

## Planting Notes
- Primary tree: coherenceism-music
- Drop-in forms: lyric prompts, guided releases, workshop reflections
