# Inspiration
Endings don’t erase; they rearrange. Tom patterns and gated snare feel like streetlights passing on the ride home. Bridge seed: “Ash to signal, nothing disappears.”

# Notes (optional)
Let the chorus open harmonically without getting louder; keep guitar lines sparse and singable.

# Style Prompt
80s alternative at 98 BPM, tom‑led Linn/707 groove with gated snare; clean guitar with subtle flange, Juno/Prophet pad, melodic bass, baritone close‑mic’d vocal; plate reverb, tape‑ish saturation. Mood: melancholy but resolute. No modern trap hats or EDM risers/supersaws; no glossy pop shine.

# Lyrics
[Instrumental Intro: 8s]
[Tom pattern with gated snare]

[Verse 1]
Tail lights blur the lane,
Old letters in the rain.
Everything we couldn’t say
Drifts into gray.

[Chorus]
The long fade,
Not gone, just rearranged.
Ash to signal—
Nothing disappears.

[Instrumental Break: 8 bars]
[Toms and gated snare carry; guitar adds sparse lines]

[Verse 2]
Key ring on a thread,
Ghost echoes in the bed.
I trace the shape you made,
Still there in the haze.

[Verse 3]
Boxes stacked along the wall,
Names I almost never call.
Every ending shifts its gear—
Turns and hums, still right here.

[Bridge]
[Bass steps out; guitar swells]
Ash to signal, we become
Wires carrying what we’ve done.

[Guitar Solo: 12 bars]
[Melodic solo over chorus changes]

[Chorus]
The long fade,
Not gone, just rearranged.
Ash to signal—
Nothing disappears.

[Chorus]
The long fade,
Not gone, just rearranged.
Ash to signal—
Nothing disappears.

[Outro]
[Toms pulse; snare gates to silence]
[Extended fade ~12s]
