# OpenAI Platform — Overview

Purpose
- Summarize main development surfaces and integration patterns relevant to coherenceism-ai. Keep it adapter-friendly and portable. Verify specifics in provider docs before release.

Surfaces (high level)
- Chat/Responses API
  - Stream text tokens; handle tool calls/functions; server returns incremental deltas and tool invocations.
  - Good control and debuggability when the app orchestrates steps.
- Assistants / Agent Workflows
  - Provider-managed orchestration and state with tool calling, potential parallelism, and structured execution plans.
  - Faster to stand up complex chains; trade control/portability for convenience.
- Realtime / Voice
  - Low-latency bidirectional sessions (WebSocket/RTC-style) for text+audio; supports advanced voice.
  - Requires server-issued ephemeral tokens and careful audio handling.
- Batch/Job-style (where available)
  - Non-interactive long-running operations; not needed for MVP chat UI.
- Fine-tuning/Vector features (optional)
  - Out of scope for MVP; rely on UFC and prompts first.

Streaming Patterns
- Text: incremental deltas; maintain a render buffer and commit on finalize.
- Tool calls: watch for structured tool events; dispatch to app tools; stream tool results back into the transcript.
- Audio (Realtime): stream frames; buffer and play; degrade to text-only on errors.

Auth & Configuration
- Server-side API key; do not expose in the browser.
- For Realtime, mint short-lived ephemeral tokens via a server endpoint.
- Keep model and feature flags configurable (.env.local in downstream app).

Limits & Cost (guidance)
- Expect per-model rate limits and token caps; apply backoff/retry.
- Stream wherever possible; chunk inputs (UFC slices) to control token size.
- Log provider errors with sanitized context for debugging.

Recommendations (MVP)
- Prefer Chat/Responses with app-driven orchestration for initial control and clarity.
- Add Realtime for advanced voice playback; keep a text-only fallback.
- Design slim adapter interfaces so providers can be swapped with minimal surface change.

References
- Mirror links to provider docs in the downstream repo README; avoid embedding URLs here to keep CORA portable.
