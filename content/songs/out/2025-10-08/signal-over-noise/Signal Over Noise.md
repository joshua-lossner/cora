# Style Prompt
Punk rock at 190–200 BPM: downpicked distorted guitars, tight bass, and fast, driving drums with a raw room‑mic mix; late‑70s UK basement‑show energy. Structure: Intro → Verse → Pre‑Chorus → Chorus → Verse → Chorus → Bridge → Instrumental Break → Double Chorus → Outro. Gritty male lead with call‑and‑response gang shouts in English; avoid metal chugs, glossy pop‑punk sheen, autotune, and EDM elements.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
Four clicks. Feedback squeal. Lights flash.

[Verse]
Static on the dial, selling me a script,
Headlines draw the lines, tighten up the grip.
Every loud opinion dressed up like a fact—
If I swallow all of it, I never make it back.

[Pre-Chorus]
Gimme one true thread I can pull and not regret—
Weave it with another till the picture starts to set.

[Chorus]
Signal over noise—coherence by choice!
No kings, no saviors, power to the voice!
Map the moving parts till the world aligns—
We stitch it all together in electric lines! (HEY!)

[Verse]
They monetize confusion, keep the rage on loop,
Algorithms bait the hook, drag another troop.
But cracks let in the light, patterns bleed through paint—
Draw the shape we live in, not the mask they saint.

[Pre-Chorus]
Gimme one real beat I can trust to hold the floor—
Kick, snare, truth—drive it like a four‑on‑the‑floor.

[Chorus]
Signal over noise—coherence by choice!
No kings, no saviors, power to the voice!
Map the moving parts till the world aligns—
We stitch it all together in electric lines! (HEY!)

[Bridge]
This isn’t worship—this is how we steer.
No single story—many minds, one ear.
We don’t kneel to answers—questions are the spark.
Read the room together—set fire to the dark!

[Instrumental Break]
Guitar scrapes, bass drones, drum fill—COUNT IN! 1‑2‑3‑4!

[Double Chorus]
Signal over noise—coherence by choice!
No kings, no saviors, power to the voice!
Signal over noise—coherence by choice!
Gang shouts: CO‑HER‑ENCE! CO‑HER‑ENCE!

[Outro]
Feedback fades to hush—heartbeat in the void.
We leave the stage in patterns, signal over noise.
