# Inspiration

Tech as instrument, not idol. Verses show simple tools helping neighbors (maps, messages, medicine); chorus invites the wire to carry a kinder signal—“Teach the wire to sing.” Dub break leans into echo as a metaphor for ripples.

# Notes (optional)

Use echo sends musically, not as wash. Keep the chorus instantly singable.

Section tags and variations
- Allowed tags include [Intro], [Verse], [Pre‑Chorus], [Chorus], [Bridge], [Instrumental Break], [Guitar Solo], [Outro].
- For a double chorus, repeat a [Chorus] section.
- Put non‑sung cues in square brackets on their own lines.

# Style Prompt
Roots reggae at 82 BPM; one‑drop drums, round bass, off‑beat guitar upstrokes, organ bubble; tasteful dub‑style echoes to illustrate “the wire.” Warm lead vocal, call‑and‑response on hook. Include an [Instrumental Break] with melodic echo fragments before the final chorus.

# Lyrics
[Intro]
[Test tone → organ swells; tape hiss]

[Verse 1]
Copper line from street to street,
Carry news and carry beat.
Tune the signal soft and kind—
Send a song into the mind.

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing,
Let the mercy travel.
Teach the wire to sing—
Love on every channel.

[Verse 2]
Maps and messages at night,
Find the lost and bring them light.
Turn the knob till voices ring—
Keep the person in the thing.

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing,
Let the mercy travel.

[Instrumental Break]
[Echo vox: “sing… sing…”; horn delay replies]

[Chorus]
Teach the wire to sing—
Love on every channel.

[Outro]
[Motif tag; faders ride the echo]
