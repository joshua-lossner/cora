# Privacy Review

## Steps
1. Inventory — enumerate data collected/processed/stored/shared
2. Purpose — state why each datum is needed; remove non-essential
3. Consent — verify user awareness and control; avoid dark patterns
4. Scope — minimize retention, access, and sharing; prefer local processing
5. Security — check transport/storage protections; plan incident response
6. Third Parties — list vendors; link policies; restrict scopes/keys
7. Documentation — update privacy policy and in-product disclosures

## Outputs
- Review notes, mitigations, and approval or follow-ups
