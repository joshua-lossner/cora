# Concept
An album for late trains and quiet rooms. It treats breath, touch, and pauses as instruments. Songs move like small decisions: a held beat, a rotated coaster, a single LED blink. Field recordings (train hum, HVAC cycles) and tape‑warm keys sit under hushed vocals. The arc moves from learning to listen (1–3), through pressure and misdirection (4–6), to alignment and a small, decisive move (7–8).

# Tracklist
1. Noise Map — reading interference; first quiet signal
2. The Quiet Signal — micro-gesture language; interpret twice, act once
3. Archive of Breath — the library listens; pauses as addresses
4. The Listening Room — tuning a window; we change us
5. False Flags — decoys and double confirmation
6. The Drift — fatigue and choosing to do nothing
7. Open Channel — power cycles align; a single LED answers
8. The Small Move — adjust a knob; the city listens

# Notes
- Keep vocals intimate and close‑miked; favor whispered harmonies.
- Drums are soft, percussive textures; avoid big cymbal wash.
- Use found sounds sparingly as rhythmic cues (door chime, power relay click).
- Alternate breathers and pushes; end tracks with small open loops.
