# example-tree

## Orientation
- Purpose: one-sentence why this tree exists.
- Surfaces: list primary mediums or formats (e.g., blog, audio, workshop).
- Branch Structure: how this downstream repo organizes its own content.

## Lineage
- Seeds: mention the CORA seeds or branches that inspired the tree.
- Dependencies: other systems or procedures this tree relies on.

Use this file to keep the forest legible from the trunk. Implementation details stay in the downstream repository.
