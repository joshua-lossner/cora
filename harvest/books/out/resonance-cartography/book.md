# Inspiration
A map that listens back. Begin with a room, a single singing bowl, and a team deciding whether to ship. We learn to tune position before we push: sense the field, reduce distortion, and let reality carry the work. Scenes stay small—meeting rooms, studios, kitchens, sidewalks—so the practices transfer. The promise: fewer heroic pushes, more right‑sized moves that ring true and endure.

# Notes
- Shape: four parts — Field, Instruments, Practices, Stewardship (4 chapters each).
- Each chapter ends with a “Small Move” the reader can try in ten minutes.
- Voice: concrete images first, then method; gentle lyricism without fluff.
- Constraint: avoid jargon; diagrams okay when they clarify a felt pattern.
- Throughline: coherence over convenience; compost endings into the next beginning.

# Concept
Resonance Cartography teaches teams to sense and shape the shared field—where attention, tone, and small moves carry more than force. The book moves from perception (Field) to shared tools (Instruments) to repeatable moves (Practices) to sustained culture (Stewardship). Each chapter closes with a ten‑minute action.

# Voice
See: voice_guide.md

- POV: second person; present tense; medium‑close distance
- Diction: plain, concrete, gently lyrical when image clarifies
- Devices: scene→method, checklists, brief vignettes; no jargon without definition

# Outline
See: outline.md

Summary: four parts × four chapters (16 total) covering Field, Instruments, Practices, Stewardship; each chapter provides a one‑line theme and 5–9 beats with a “Small Move.”

# Characters
See: character_bible.md

Personas: Facilitator, Product Lead, Engineer, Skeptic; plus secondary cast (Executive Sponsor, Customer Proxy, Designer). They anchor examples and sample lines.

# Notes
This trunk edition is vendor‑neutral and prose‑only. Downstream overlays may add diagrams or interactive canvases that implement the resonance map and rhythm ledger.
